        In 1770, with the purpose of presenting an unusual surprising gift to his mother Empress Dowager Chongqing (1692-1777) for her eightieth birthday, Emperor Qianlong (1711-1799) ordered the imperial architectural department to construct a Buddhist compound namedjile shijieor blissful land on the northern shore of imperial Beihai Park next to the Forbidden City. Inside of the main hall, instead of conventional Buddhist icons staged on the lotus pedestals, an innovative three-dimensional clay mountain site scenery adorned with various deities from the Pure Land occupies the interior space.Jileshijie, a synonym for the Western Paradise and Pure Land, has been consistently visualized and contemplated since early medieval China. But thejile shijiebuilt for Empress Dowager Chongqing is a standalone case which creates the experience of religious joy through a site scenery.The Pure Land is usually experienced as a future connected to death, which one literally cannot experience as present. However, Qianlong’s filial gift allows his mother to feel the required affect in this world, by juxtaposing transcendence and immanence. The absolute future of the Pure Land, a future that one experiences only after one has no more future on earth, becomes present at least in part, in a man-made small-scale western paradise. In this paper, I will discuss the surviving architecture, sculptural mountain preserved in old photographs, imperial documents on the design process, and Qianlong’s own writings on the given subject. Through unpacking the layers of this site, I will demonstrate how a liminal temporality of religious joy is materialized.

        The Center for Chinese Studies presents a Faculty Roundtable with David J. Mozina in conversation with Jonathan Pettit and Edward Davis. Dr. Mozina studies living Daoist and Buddhist ritual traditions in Hunan province in south China, and the roots of those traditions in the liturgical vibrancy of the Song, Yuan, and early Ming periods and in the religious traditions of the late imperial period. Jonathan Pettit is Associate Professor of Chinese Religions at UHM. His research focuses on the production and dissemination of Daoist texts, both in the medieval era and in contemporary groups such as the Yiguandao. Edward Davis is Associate Professor of Chinese History at UHM. His research focuses on the social and cultural history of Middle Imperial China (750-1600) and the history of Chinese religions from the ancient period until the present. This webinar is co-sponsored by the UHM Departments of History and Religion.

        This talk explores China’s National New Area experimental urban development zones as ‘infrastructure spaces’ of diffuse and fragmented urbanization. Such spaces typically feature a rapidly built, large scale infrastructure grid laid upon an existing though increasingly obsolete rural landscape. They also seem to suggest a new model of urban development that deliberately eschews agglomeration and existing urban nodes. While rural residents struggle to reinvent their lives in preparation for the promised city-to-come, the inherent incompleteness of the infrastructure space introduces a state of suspension that envelops everyday life in the New Area. The central role of transportation infrastructures, and the logics of suspension and circulation that obtain in these spaces, provide echoes of historical Chinese and Asian patterns of urbanization in which the neat and tidy distinctions between rural and urban that underlie conventional (Western) urban theory have never materialized.

        The rollout and development of BRI cooperation is seen as a dynamic process and is discussed in terms of five successive phases: 1) Rollout; 2) Routinization; 3) Community of Shared Destiny; 4) Diversifying aims and adapting to constraints; 5) Covid and post-Covid adjustments. The overall process is seen as progressing from extensive to intensive development; and as successively broadening in scope from economic to political, socio-cultural, and security cooperation. Finally, BRI will be situated in the context of China’s “major power diplomacy” and “great struggle” to realize “a great dream.”

        Data is the lifeblood of the digital economy. It is also an arena of fierce maneuvering as China and the United States seek to gain a leg-up in key industries that will define the Fourth Industrial Revolution. President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to deepen the integration of Internet, big data and artificial intelligence with the real economy, and in just the past few months a number of important regulations have been issued. These include: (a) a revised cybersecurity regulation for network platform operators (stemming from the Didi Chuxing IPO debacle), (b) proposed security assessment rules for cross-border data export, and (c) proposed unified network data security regulations to implement China’s Data Security Law (DSL), Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and Cybersecurity Law. For his part, President Biden issued an executive order in June 2021 on protecting Americans’ sensitive data from foreign adversaries, and the Commerce Department followed up in November 2021 with a proposed rule that could well lead to platforms like TikTok being subjected to third-party auditing and monitoring of user data logs. Earlier, the Trump administration’s Treasury Department had enumerated ten categories of sensitive personal data to be placed beyond the reach of foreign adversaries.

What are the drivers behind the U.S. and China’s divergent approaches on data sovereignty? What are the key takeaways from these rules and regulations? Who are the key players involved? What are the investment implications for entrepreneurs and investors on both sides? And as the two sides seek to influence the Indo-Pacific’s cross-border data flow rules and standards, what are the implications of their increasingly mutually decoupled data universes for regional partners as well as for realizing a region-wide digital trade agreement?

        A growing body of research on urban India and China shows that the concepts drawn from the histories of urbanization in the West are not adequate for understanding the new forms of power, networks, capital, and infrastructure that constitute the rapidly changing urban ecologies of China and India. The authors of two recent books will discuss the meanings and significance of the “urban” in two of the largest and most populous urban centers in the world: Greater Mumbai and the Municipality of Chongqing. Drawing from their research on transformational processes that span conventional boundaries of rural-urban, formal-informal, state-society, citizen-subject, the panel addresses questions of governance, migration, infrastructure, and public goods provision.

        The Indigenous languages of Taiwan feature two patterns of morphological discrepancy. First, only some possess a symmetrical morphological paradigm associated with a phenomenon known as ‘noun-verb homophony’. Second, only a handful of the languages allow the Proto-Austronesian stative affix ma- to be used in a transitive clause. This talk addresses how these two foci of variation inform our understanding of the Austronesian diaspora and further explains how new comparative data on these phenomena offers a simpler answer to two ongoing debates in the field.

        Late Ming and Early Qing was a period during which China underwent a transformation both on intellectual thoughts and society life, influenced with Western natural science (more precisely, natural philosophy) and Catholicism transmitted by European Jesuits. In the course of cultural exchange, the interpretations of “heaven” were manifested in different intellectual levels, including philosophy, theology and astronomical calendar.

This talk focuses on Xu Guangqi and Fang Yizhi, two representative figures of cultural exchange but with different attitudes towards western learning in late Ming China, and presents how they confronted the conflict and competition in discourse between Neo-Confucianism and Western learning, how both sides tried to find an accommodation. The presentation particularly introduces image-numerology in study onThe Book of Changewhich became an important medium of integration between Confucianism and western natural philosophy, and shows traditional Chinese science has its thought resources in philosophy. If this is the case, beyond the usual perspectives of responding to the “Needham Problem” from history of science and intellectual history, the philosophical perspective on this issue actually reflects the complexity of universality and diversity in science as well as in culture.

        This research explores the credit economy of the tea trade between China and the United States from 1784 – 1842. Preoccupied with the large volume of silver flowing into China, previous research portrayed China’s foreign trade as a cumbersome system undergirded primarily by a barter economy and silver payments. This research, however, spotlights cashless payments in China, particularly promissory notes and bills of exchange which were conventionally considered as financial devices of Western capitalism. These credit instruments had commonly facilitated de facto transactions between Chinese and U.S. merchants in the tea trade. Moreover, Chinese traders loaned millions of dollars to their American counterparts through promissory notes, thus lubricating the money-scarce early U.S. economy. Through the flow of tea and opium, bills of exchange produced an active financial market in China, which eventually triggered the Panic of 1837 in the United States and the First Opium War in China.

        The fundamental reason for the extreme leverage today in China’s banks, enterprises and the state itself is found in the decentralized fiscal arrangements of highly self-reliant local governments. This problem has been compounded by the excessive stimulus lending over the past decade. As a result Beijing has promoted the creation of an extensive shadow banking system designed to protect the stability of the major state banks. Stepping back this has led to the state’s growing leverage. This presentation focuses on the impact of the shadow banking system on the state’s finances and compares the costs of China’s response to the global financial crisis with the US response.

        In January 2017, John Bolton, foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations advocated that the United States revisit their “One-China policy” and reevaluate their political and military relationship with Taiwan as China had become “increasingly belligerent” in recent years. In addition to increasing military sales to Taiwan, he urged the United States to also interpret the Taiwan Relations Act more broadly and redeploy “at least some” U.S. forces from Okinawa to Taiwan, which would allow Washington to monitor China’s military activities in the South China Sea more closely, and enable the rapid deployment of forces throughout the region “should the need arise.”

Bolton’s hawkish proposal is a provocative response to China’s rising economic and military power, and its antagonism towards Taiwanese nationalism after the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) returned to power in 2016. This also has to be understood as being part of the reshaping of the work project framework under the U.S.-Japan Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty since the re-militarization of Japan in 2015.

In response to the resurgence of Cold War scenarios in the transpacific setting, this talk discusses short stories from the Japanese and Taiwanese-controlled Cold War islands of Okinawa and Kinmen. I will explore how literary representations of Cold War historical experiences and traumatic memories problematize the complicit yet asymmetrical relations between U.S. imperialism, the authorities of Japan and Taiwan, and the local patriarchy. Taking inspiration from Sakai Naoki’s “regime of translation,” I also examine how liminal perspectives and Japanophone/Sinophone articulations in these works illuminate the mechanism of ethno-national identity-making under Cold War politics and its repercussions.

        Chinese poetry has a long history of interaction with the visual arts. Classical aesthetic thought held that painting, calligraphy, and poetry were cross-fertilizing and mutually enriching. What happened when the Chinese poetic tradition encountered photography, a transformative technology and presumably realistic medium that reshaped seeing and representing the world?

Shengqing Wu explores how the new medium of photography was transformed by Chinese aesthetic culture. She details the complex negotiations between poetry and photography in the late Qing and early Republican eras, examining the ways traditional textual forms collaborated with the new visual culture. Drawing on extensive archival research into illustrated magazines, poetry collections, and vintage photographs, Photo Poetics analyzes a wide range of practices and genres, including self-representation in portrait photography; gifts of inscribed photographs; mass-media circulation of images of beautiful women; and photography of ghosts, immortals, and imagined landscapes. Wu argues that the Chinese lyrical tradition provided rich resources for artistic creativity, self-expression, and embodied experience in the face of an increasingly technological and image-oriented society. An interdisciplinary study spanning literary studies, visual culture, and media history, Photo Poetics is an original account of media culture in early twentieth-century China and the formation of Chinese literary and visual modernities.

        This talk builds on recent scholarship that takes seriously fantasmatic portrayals of transmutation in Chinese porcelain manufacture. The speaker argues that creative accounts—theatrical and narrative, Chinese and European—position porcelain as a substance hovering on the cusp between life and death, person and thing, animate and inanimate. To do so, she will take you through Chinese materials as diverse as a Ming court opera about the eunuch admiral Zheng He, strange cases of statues that haunt, hagiographies of self-sacrificing artisans who immolate themselves in the kiln, and a stop-motion animation film comprised entirely of porcelain by contemporary artist Geng Xue. The catalyst for the project is the recent performance in New York and Chicago of an 18th century French pantomime-ballet about an evil sorcerer who transforms people into porcelain. This brilliant new production, co-created by art historian Meredith Martin and the choreographer and Asian American activist Phil Chan, reimagines a work from the height of the European chinoiserie craze in a way that both captures the magic of porcelain and addresses current politics of race in the arts for a 21st century audience.

        Over the last decades, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea. China’s economic sanctions may also have long-term effects in deterring and shaping countries’ foreign policy interests that go well beyond the short-term economic costs. The talk will highlight how Taiwan responds to China’s economic sanctions. It demonstrates the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power The second part of this presentation offers initial thoughts on establishing a trade pact in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s unilateral economic sanctions. More specifically, Taiwan and Australia have much to offer the rest of the world regarding how to respond to China’s economic coercion.

What is the relationship between internal development and integration into the global economy in developing countries? How and why do state–market relations differ? And do these differences matter in the post-cold war era of global conflict and cooperation? Drawing on research in China, India, and Russia and examining sectors from textiles to telecommunications, Micro-institutional Foundations of Capitalism introduces a new theory of sectoral pathways to globalization and development. Roselyn Hsueh is an associate professor of political science at Temple University, where she co-directs the Certificate in Political Economy.

Literary imaginations about modern China are often synonymous with imaginations about “new people.” This talk focuses on how such imaginations unfolded and evolved in 20th-century Chinese science fiction. In particular, it calls attention to the dynamic interaction between translation and creation, and to the genre’s close engagement with ongoing ideological and literary debates within the national context. Jing Jiang is Associate Professor of Chinese and Humanities at Reed College. She teaches courses on Chinese language, literature, and culture. Aside from her book on twentieth century Chinese science fiction, she is also published in Asian Cinema, Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, Cultural Critique, and positions. She received the ACLS Pauline Yu Fellowship in 2020, and is currently working on a new book project tentatively titled &quot;The World Embedded in Modern Chinese Literary Imagination.&quot;

        The Great Exodus examines one of the least understood forced migrations in modern East Asia—the human exodus from China to Taiwan following the Nationalist collapse and Chinese Communist victory in 1949. Peeling back layers of Cold War ideological constructs, the book tells a very different story from conventional historiographies the Chinese civil war, Chinese revolution, and Cold War Taiwan.

        The Great Exodusexamines one of the least understood forced migrations in modern East Asia—the human exodus from China to Taiwan following the Nationalist collapse and Chinese Communist victory in 1949. Peeling back layers of Cold War ideological constructs, the book tells a very different story from conventional historiographies the Chinese civil war, Chinese revolution, and Cold War Taiwan. Underscoring the displaced population’s trauma of living in exile and their poignant “homecomings” four decades later, Yang presents a multiple-event trajectory of repeated traumatization with the recurring search for home, belonging, and identity. By portraying the Chinese civil war exiles in Taiwan both as traumatized subjects of displacement and overbearing colonizers to the local peoples, this thought-provoking work challenges the established notions of trauma, memory production, diaspora, and reconciliation. It speaks to the importance of subject position, boundary-crossing empathic unsettlements, and ethical responsibility of researching, narrating, and representing historical trauma.

This talk examines citizen scoring in and public support for China’s Social Credit System (SCS). Dr. Fan analyzed the mechanism of credit scoring embedded in the SCS and show two facets of the SCS: a normative apparatus fostering “good” citizens and a regulative apparatus normalizing “deviant” behaviors. He also used a survey experiment to test how types of monitored behaviors and different information exposure explain public support for the SCS. The findings suggest that citizens are more likely to support monitoring financial behaviors. More importantly, exposure to Western media increases public support for monitoring non-financial behaviors in the SCS. Fan Liang (PhD, University of Michigan) is an Assistant Professor of Media at Duke Kunshan University. His research examines how new communication technologies construct social and political changes, and how social and political powers shape and regulate the design and operation of such technologies.

        People tend to think of decolonization in Asia as being a phenomenon of the Cold War Era, where European colonizers, having survived humiliating blows of Japanese occupation of their Asian colonies during the Second World War, reluctantly but unavoidably relinquished their suzerainty and allowed numerous new nation-states to emerge in the Asia-Pacific through the first three decades of the postwar period.

In reality, the South China Sea and its surrounding political entities have always been a realm of influence of a superpower external to the region; the British Empire during the Colonial Era and the US through much of the latter half of the 20thcentury. No sooner US influence started to recede with the conclusion of the Cold War, than South China Sea starts to experience the hegemonic encroachment of rising China. Taiwan feels the heat of increasing PRC pressure upon her precarious independent status in the global arena, while Hong Kong’s freedom once guaranteed by the Basic Law and the ‘1 country 2 systems’ principle has been continuously and methodically dismantled from the earliest years of Xi Jinping’s presidency. The democratizing trend of Southeast Asia has suffered similar setbacks, with Thailand and Myanmar reverting back to military rule and returning to draconian measures to suppress pro-democracy protesters.

The online pro-democracy network known as the ‘Milk Tea Alliance,’ which emerged in April 2020, among netizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, is the first online movement to vocalize what has been a long standing yet unspeakable suspicion among the younger generation of this region—that the Chinese Communist Government is a mutual obstacle for democratization of the Asia-Pacific. For the first time in history, the fight for Taiwan independence, Hong Kong’s freedom, and Thailand and Myanmar’s democratization becomes one and the same, united by the superpower threat against democracy and human rights in the form of PRC influence across the region. The ‘Milk Tea Alliance’ quest for freedom is the last of the unfinished business from the colonial era. It is the long overdue last wave of decolonization in Asia.

        For our April book club we’re reading Joan Is Okay in preparation for our chat with the author, Weike Wang. --- Joan is a thirty-something ICU doctor at a busy New York City hospital. The daughter of Chinese parents who came to the United States to secure the American dream for their children, Joan is intensely devoted to her work, happily solitary, successful. She does look up sometimes and wonder where her true roots lie: at the hospital, where her white coat makes her feel needed, or with her family, who try to shape her life by their own cultural and social expectations.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
