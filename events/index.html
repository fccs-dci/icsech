        What can India and China, the world’s most populous countries, teach us about meritocracy? InMaking Meritocracy, Professors Tarun Khanna and Michael Szonyi have gathered over a dozen experts from a range of disciplines to discuss how these two societies have addressed the issue of building meritocracy historically, philosophically, and in practice. India and China have considered how to identify and promote merit for centuries, and their attempts at developing meritocracies in the past, present, and future holds lessons for each other, and for the rest of the world.

        In Zen Buddhism, the notion ofhere and nowis the key to attain––or return to––paññā/prajñā(insight). On a day-to-day basis, we live each moment with a preoccupation of the past and an anticipation for the future. Our retrospection and expectation produce afflictions such as avarice, anger and frustration, as well as delusion. Our penchant for living every moment as a recollection of the past and an anticipation for the future is also propelled by our belief that our existence endures in time; that such afflictions and suffering are both inevitable; and that ourselfand all the other sentient beings and objects arise out of their self-natures. But as Nāgārjuna (150–250 CE) argues, the past does not exist, as its existence has already perished; the future does not exist, as its existence has yet to arise. If the present is an extension of the past, and if it extends itself to become the future, the present does not exist either. Rather, it is a lived point-instant that instantiates an assemblage of interdependent conditions. But how does the cinema, as an image-consciousness, disconceal insight?

  InCinema Illuminating Reality[2022],I conduct a comparative reading ofhere and nowwith Gilles Deleuze’s reading of Henri Bergson’s notion of time. I do so in order to reconfigure Deleuze’s notion of the time-image into the insight-image. For Deleuze, the time-image is characterized as a pure optical and sound situation, which draws the consciousness’s attention to the present of the present as a sense-formation and a thought-formation. In other words, Deleuze’s time-image is capable of generating a mindfulness of thehere and now:that each moment is an instantiation of an ecology of interdependent conditions that affect, and are affected by, one another. In my presentation, I will demonstrate how insight can be attained or returned to via the formational process of the image-consciousness. I will also conduct a close reading of Pema Tseden’sTharlo[2015] to examine how mindfulness is mobilized as a technology that gives the consciousness an agency over its own becoming.

        It is commonly assumed that a sustained Chinese presence in the Mekong River Delta first occurred during the late seventeenth century, when Ming loyalist refugees fleeing from their homeland sought and received permission from the Nguyen lord of Cochinchina, in present-day central-southern Vietnam, to settle down and open up the land. In fact, a close examination of primary documents, some of them rarely utilized, reveals that the Chinese presence in the delta long preceded the seventeenth century. Moreover, the Ming loyalists themselves were independent actors who participated in the scramble for this sparsely populated frontier through cooperation and competition with Cochinchina, Cambodia, and Siam, as well as strategic submission to one or more of the three state actors. At the same time, they faced opportunities and constraints in the politics of their homeland, including the triumph of the Manchus and China's reemergence as a naval power. Through an examination of Chinese settlement in the Mekong Delta, this talk highlights how they reflected and contributed to the &quot;Chinese century&quot; in eighteenth-century Southeast Asia.

        The post-World War II period saw China debate many issues that still have immense importance for understanding the China of today. China moved into a new phase of internationalization, becoming embroiled in global debates about the links between economic and social development. Ideological concerns about democracy, constitutionalism, and the implications of a powerful new political force emerging in the countryside, were also to the forefront. Meanwhile, new ideas about the interaction of gender and class fuelled debates over identity.

        Asian countries have grown at a record-setting pace this century, generating enormous economic growth and becoming hubs of creativity and cosmopolitanism for millions of residents, but also resulting in displacement of lower-income residents and unequal distribution of wealth. In some places, this has led to protests and the emergence of new social movements proclaiming the rights to housing, to subsistence, and “to the city.” Professor Hyun Bang Shin [Shin, Hyun Bang], a professor of geography and urban studies at the London School of Economics and Political Science and director of Saw Swee Hock Southeast Asia Centre, will share his analysis from years of studying urban development and anti-gentrification movements in Asian cities, especially those in South Korea, China, and Southeast Asia. His discussant will be Duke Law Professor Qiao Shitong, who is an expert on property rights in China.

        Recent reprint projects have given researchers much improved access to the vast corpus of Chinese court dramatic texts kept in palace archives and private collections, which in turn presents a challenge: how do we unpack the complex textual web and varied forms contained therein? I am interested in ways of reading court drama in connection with the wider textual and cultural worlds. This talk will focus on a body of texts that I call “local court drama”– playtexts that were presented to the emperor from across various regions, produced on occasions ranging from the celebration of imperial birthdays to welcoming the sovereign on tours. We will look at the textual problems and the generic labels applied, literary modelsinvoked, and identities represented in the process.

Following the launch of his new book,America's Great-Power Opportunity: Revitalizing U.S. Foreign Policy to Meet the Challenges of Strategic Competition,Wyne joins the China Program’s Author Series to discuss how the United States must avoid complacency and consternation in appraising China and Russia. Rather than attempting the unfeasible—countering their current and future initiatives and forestalling subsequent provocations—Wyne argues that Washington should formulate a more practical, creative, and sustainable foreign policy that can advance U.S. national interests regardless of what steps Beijing and Moscow take, and that recent competitive missteps give the U.S. space to undertake this task.

        Latin America’s recent commodity 'supercycle,' a synchronized and sustained price increase lasting more than five years, was largely driven by a major influx in Chinese investment, finance and demand for raw materials. Throughout that boom – and the slump that followed – Amazon basin countries sought to balance economic, social and environmental priorities by strengthening and then relaxing their regulatory regimes. To what extent has the cooling of the 'China boom' led to a region-wide relaxation of social and environmental standards? And where protections were relaxed, did those reforms lead to greater, faster or higher-risk Chinese investment? In forthcoming research, Paulo Esteves, Coordinator, Socio-Environmental Platform and the Global South Unit for Mediation, BRICS Policy Center of the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, and Rebecca Ray, Senior Academic Researcher with the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, explore the implications for managing environmental and social protections amid natural resource booms, protecting the cultural and biological diversity of the Amazon basin and promoting host country governance throughout the Belt and Road Initiative.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.

        China’s overseas economic activity is diversifying beyond official development finance from its two main policy banks, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China. Despite the array of various debt, equity and grant financing mechanisms China’s policy banks have at their disposal, separate multi-stakeholder funds have emerged that are increasing Chinese financing capacity for overseas development projects. Since the mid-2000s, Chinese public and private financing institutions have established specialized investment funds that primarily provide equity financing to sector and region-specific development projects. These 'Overseas Development Investment Funds' (ODIFs) are an increasingly mentioned feature of Chinese foreign direct investment and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) financing instruments. Drawing on forthcoming research, Oyintarelado (Tarela) Moses, Data Analyst and Database Manager for the Global China Initiative at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and Laura Gormley, Research Assistant to the Global China Initiative, will explore the unique features, financing capacity, policy implications and future potential of China’s ODIFs.

        The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the public finances of African countries. It also led to rising debt levels in many African countries and has increased concerns about their ability to make their scheduled sovereign debt payments over the next few years. This looming debt crisis raises questions about how these countries can most effectively manage their debts and how their creditors can help them develop in sustainable and inclusive ways. Daniel Bradlow, SARCHI Professor of International Development Law and African Economic Relations at the University of Pretoria, and Magalie Masamba, Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria, will present key findings from the 2021 book, “COVID-19 and Sovereign Debt: The Case of SADC”, a multi-disciplinary publication focusing on the issue of African sovereign debt management and renegotiation/restructuring in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).
