        An obscure reef in the South China Sea has become the latest flashpoint in China’s long-running campaign to dominate the South China Sea. Since last summer, the Chinese Coast Guard has repeatedly employed water cannons, lasers, and acoustic weapons and rammed Philippine Navy and Coast Guard vessels to prevent them from resupplying military personnel positioned at Second Thomas Shoal. The US labels China’s actions as violations of international law and has confirmed that its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines extends to attacks on Philippine vessels at sea. Jay Batongbacal, a lawyer and professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law, will discuss how this tiny maritime feature became a potential conflict site, why a 2016 ruling by an international tribunal in the Philippines’ favor has not ended the dispute, and how international law can continue to be effective in the face of Chinese attacks. Peter Dutton, an adjunct professor of international law at NYU School of Law, will be the moderator.

        FROM COMRADES TO ENEMIES:  THREE CHINESE INTERPRETERS’ TANGLED PATHS FROM THE PACIFIC WAR TO THE KOREAN WAR AND THE COLD WAR

        In the Second World War, the Chinese Nationalist government mobilized more than 4,000 Chinese college students as interpreters for the American and British Allied forces in the China-Burma-India theater. Discharged after V-J Day, most interpreters resumed and completed their education while China descended into civil war. By 1949, most of the former interpreters remained in China, while some 200 fled to Taiwan and over 100 studied or worked in the United States. In the wake of China’s intervention in the Korean War, the United Nations Command (UNC) was in desperate need of Chinese linguists. However, Washington avoided mobilizing Chinese interpreters within the United States, leaving the task to General Douglas MacArthur, who hired more than 70 linguists from Taiwan, mostly former WWII interpreters. These interpreters served not only at the UNC headquarters in Tokyo but also on the front lines, in POW camps, and in the negotiation tents at Panmunjom, leading to the rise of the anti-Communist POWs and the prolongation of the armistice negotiations and the war. On the Chinese Communist side, a small number of former WWII interpreters served as POW interrogators and medical doctors. Drawing on archival documents, newspapers, and memoirs, this talk traces the divergent and intertwined paths of three former interpreters from the Second World War to the Korean War and the Cold War. It reveals the multifaceted encounters between the Chinese interpreters and the Americans, as well as among the interpreters themselves, first as comrades and later as allies and enemies.

Weixing, or “surname guessing,” was a highly organized lottery practice in China wherein money was bet on the surnames of which candidates would pass the civil and military examinations. Opening with a weixing-related examination scandal in 1885, En Li reconstructs the inner mechanisms of weixing and other lottery games in the southern province of Guangdong and traces a series of institutional revenue innovations surrounding lottery regulation from the 1850s to the early 1900s, and depicts an expansive community created by the lottery with cultural and informational channels stretching among Guangdong, Southeast Asia, and North America. This book sheds light on a new reality that emerged during the final decades of China’s last imperial dynasty, with a nuanced understanding of competitions, strategic thinking by lottery players and public officials.

        Join UW-TSP on Wednesday, February 7 at 3:30pm in THO 317 and onlineas we welcome Professor Ian Rowen to discuss his newly published bookOne China, Many Taiwans: The Geopolitics of Cross-Strait Tourism.One China, Many Taiwans examines how tourism, one of several strategies employed by the PRC at exerting political control over Taiwan, aggravated tensions between the two polities, polarized Taiwanese society, and pushed Taiwanese popular sentiment further toward support for national self-determination.

Professor Rowen will focus on how Chinese tourism bifurcated Taiwan into “Two Taiwans”—one performed as a part of China for Chinese group tourists, versus the other experienced as a site of everyday life by local residents and some independent tourists. He will also delve into how this process amplified conflict between those business, civil society, and state actors that had a differing interest in sustaining a PRC-oriented tourist industry, creating an increasingly pluralistic civic nationalism in Taiwan.

Ian Rowenis Associate Professor in the Department of Taiwan Culture, Languages and Literature at National Taiwan Normal University. Previously an assistant professor of Geography and Sociology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he earned his PhD in Geography from the University of Colorado at Boulder.

This event was made possible by the generous support of the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.

        The project 'Regionalizing Infrastructures in Chinese History' invites scholars of Chinese and European archaeology and history to participate in the international workshop 'Perspectives on the Materiality of City Walls in China and Europe'. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different archaeological contexts to share best practices in the analysis of archaeological knowledge production, to identify key issues within existing practices, and to explore approaches to materiality in archaeology by examining case studies from various geographical areas and historical eras.

Participants are invited to submit preliminary position papers (up to 5 pages) which will be discussed during the two sessions. Travel for participants will be covered within Europe.

Panel 1:Archaeological reporting(10.00 - 12.30)

How researchers engage with the materiality of city walls, the capacity of those walls to modify the perception and action of humans, depends often on local approaches to the material. On one hand, archeological reports serve as a starting point for reconstructing archaeological knowledge-making processes in different locations and, by extension, for discerning theoretical trends and dominant ideas in archaeological science. On the other hand, archaeology is notorious for the amount of gray literature it creates. How do we facilitate access to this information as archaeologists? How do we extract meaningful data from them?

The reports, both published and unpublished, create opportunities to discuss methodological approaches, different frameworks, as well as blind spots of archaeological reporting. This panel invites researchers to examine how the materiality of city walls shape the perception and action of archaeologists, policymakers, and others who engage with the material remains of city walls in the present by addressing, among others, the following questions:

● Are there local, regional, and national trends in archaeological research on city walls (and infrastructure in general)?

● Are city walls a priority in choosing sites? Are certain time periods given priority?

● Is research on city walls only driven from above (i.e. by new infrastructure development and state-sponsored tourism), or does some of it come from below?

● Can digital technologies facilitate local, regional, and global comparative investigations of material remains of city walls?

Panel 2:Materiality and communication(14.00-17.00)

Andrea Mubi Brighenti and Mattias Kärrhold, in their introduction toUrban Walls: Political and Cultural Meanings of Vertical Structures and Surfaces(2018),refer to walls asmaterial and semiotic technologies of inter- visibility managementand walling as atechnology of social interaction. In archaeological interpretations, city walls delineate ingroups and outgroups; they demonstrate seemingly clear borders between past and present regimes. In recent years the renewed interest in city walls as tourist attractions has made it so that city walls everywhere are treated as local/national symbols. City walls create bonds and barriers to this day; they are sources of safety and alienation, and in recent years walls are a source of revenue through tourism. They also influence city planning and community relations. This panel explores how city walls create social relations by examining, among others, the following questions:

● How are memories of city walls transmitted? What is the role of city walls in inculcating culture (generatinghabitus)?

● How are experiences of the materiality of city walls reflected in archaeological finds of different groups?

● How do city walls mediate the relationship between the sacred and the profane?

● How have city walls enabled infrastructural violence and inequality in the past? Do they have an impact on violence and inequality today?

● How can archaeological research into the materiality of city walls help us understand and address contemporary teichopolitics?

Deadline for abstracts (up to 200 words):December 1, 2023.
