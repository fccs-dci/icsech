        The talk explores a series of Chinese-made English-Chinese lexicons published in the 1850s and 1860s in Canton and Hong Kong, which represented the first local attempts to systematically facilitate English language learning among Chinese communities, and which brought my archival search to Australia in July 2024. These lexicons show two key characteristics. First, the authors were native Cantonese speakers who followed similar life paths, starting as businessmen in South Chinese ports before becoming part of the influential Shanghai and Guangdong merchant-official circles crucial to the modernisation efforts of late-Qingyangwuera. The lexicons themselves reflect the authors' budding modern ideas, conceived at a young age. Second, the lexicons were unequivocally made in written Cantonese for Cantonese native speakers, a transatlantic community encompassing traders and merchants in South China ports, school students on China Education Mission (1872–1881) in the United States, and the broader, ordinary but increasingly engaging Chinese diaspora, whose demand for practical language aids were thoughtfully anticipated and whose abilities were considered mobilisable by the lexicographers. Recently discovered manuscripts of one of the authors, housed in the Yale archives, reveal that his English reference series reached audiences not only in China, Japan, and U.S. Chinatowns but also in Australia, garnering mixed reviews from overseas scholars. Intriguingly, oral histories from this lexicographer's descendants suggest that he may have briefly resided in Melbourne as a herbalist storekeeper before creating his first bilingual lexicon in Hong Kong in 1868. My investigation in Australia led me to one of the three surviving copies of his initial lexicon at the Mitchell Library in Sydney, as well as passenger records in the Public Records Office Victoria. These findings shed light on the potential ties between early Chinese modernizers and Australia.

        Sydney China Distinguished Fellow Presents

Please join us for another two events presented by Professor Connery.

14 August |Confronting the Present: Grass Stage &amp;amp; the Vicissitudes of Social Theatre

30 August |Grass Stage and the Fate of Social Theater in Xi Jinping’s China



This hybrid event is co-presented with theDiscipline of Gender and Cultural Studies.Zoom link will be provided late. You are also welcome to join us for drinks at Courtyard cafe after the talk.



China’s economic and social development over the last 25 years has featured significant elements from the neoliberal playbook–ideologies of competition and human capital, market metrics, efficiency, suppression of labor rights, and more–coexisting with severe state limitations on private property, impediments to the formation of a capitalist class, and, especially in the last ten years, an expansion of state-owned enterprises and party control of the economy. This talk argues for the continued relevance of neoliberalism to an understanding of China today, and suggests that China’s particular and limited neoliberal character offers insights into the nature of contemporary capitalism, and of its antagonists.

About the speaker

Christopher Conneryis Professor in the Literature department at the University of California Santa Cruz, where he teaches Cultural Studies, Chinese Studies, and courses in Marxist and neoliberal theory. He has also served recently as Visiting Professor in the graduate department of Cultural Studies at Shanghai University. His research has involved four areas: early imperial Chinese culture and history (Empire of the Text: Writing and Authority in Early Imperial China ;contributions to theColumbia History of Chinese Literature) ; oceanic ideology and mythos in global capitalism (articles inboundary 2,Journal of Historical Geography,PMLA,Harvard Design Magazine, et al); the global 1960s (various anthologized articles, plus special issues ofboundary 2andInter-Asia Cultural Studies); and contemporary Chinese culture, ideology, and politics (articles inMade in China,boundary 2,New Left Review, et al). Since 2010 he has been involved as writer, performer, and political consultant in the Shanghai-based, Chinese-language social and experimental theater group Grass Stage, which has performed throughout China, as well as in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Macao, and North America.

        在大正时代，日本帝国站在历史的十字路口：一方面国内发展民主，国际上积极融入世界主流，另一方面明治时代晚期以来的民族主义、国家主义暗潮涌动。两种力量互相博弈，让日本帝国充满张力。随着大萧条的到来，日本军部势力急剧扩张，制造九一八事变，导致脱离“国联”，国家失去正确的方向，超国家主义渐成主流。日本帝国越来越排斥和仇视欧美自由主义，最终与德意法西斯走到一起，结成轴心国同盟，让日本帝国不可挽回地走向战争深渊，走向毁灭。近代日本是中国的镜子，也是中国的鞭子。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道收看讲座。

At an annual rate of 49 abortions per 1,000 reproductive-aged women, China has one of the highest abortion rates in the world. This presentation situates contemporary Chinese views of abortion within long-running debates about the ethics of abortion, its implications for gender equality, and its value as a tool of social engineering. Moreover, this lecture explains how abortion inadvertently became a primary method of fertility control in China.

Gender quotas have a long history in China, with the earliest gender quota introduced in 1933 in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s border regions. Yet, research on China’s gender quotas has been scarce. This study addresses the gap by examining the process of gender quota adoption in China’s subnational Party-States and the People’s Congresses. Using an institutional approach, we argue that quota adoption in China was a process of “institutional layering” that lasted from the late 1980s to the 2010s, during which domestic actors contested the CCP’s existing personnel rules and strategically exploited the CCP’s ideological commitment to gender equity and its need for an improved international image during the second wave of global gender quota adoption. During the process, we see two changes: the slow diversification of domestic actors, including both state and non-state ones, and the shifting of the actors’ working strategy from an informal and network-based approach to an institutionalized one that operated through formal channels. In so doing, this article expands the comparative literature on gender quotas, which has been preoccupied with quotas in elected parliaments, and enriches understanding of Chinese politics.

        This talk will introduce the China’s ‘red collectors’, collectors of ‘red relics’: objects relating to the Chinese Communist Party, People’s Liberation Army and the history of Chinese socialism. In introducing these collectors, the talk will seek to make two arguments. The first is that these collections and the motivations of those who collect them are much more varied and diverse than most of the academic literature has hitherto acknowledged. The talk will present a history of the field and through tracing the emergence of the field of collecting from the 1980s onwards, will argue that any critical potential the field may have initially embodied has been eliminated through its gradual professionalisation. In parallel with this, the self-identity of the collectors has risen, with collectors now seeing themselves as patriotic members of the cultural elite, and as transmitters of history, culture and ‘positive energy’ to the younger generation.

This study examines family property structures in relocated rural communities in the urbanizing China. Drawing on survey and interview data from Ningxia, Northwestern China, this study illustrates how relocated housing properties were divided between male and female family members. The findings suggest that both gender and family structures matter in shaping family property structures. On the one hand, men tended to receive more housing properties across different families. On the other hand, women’s access to family properties is affected by mechanisms different from that of men. Given the changes in government policies and local customs, rural families have adapted their strategies of property management but patriarchal traditions have coexisted and interacted with new demands and new tensions among family members in the era of urbanization.

Women’s Entitlement in China’s Urbanization: Family Division of Relocated Housing Properties(Monday 19 August 2024)



This presentation focuses on how Chinese female political leaders are represented in media, through the examination of the People’s Daily’s coverage of female Politburo members since 1949: Jiang Qing, Ye Qun, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yi, Liu Yandong and Sun Chunlan. Existing scholarship argues that media representation of women’s political life reflects existing gender norms of ‘public man, private women’, and largely sees the relationship between media, gender and political leadership as static.

The representation of early generations of female Chinese leaders confirms this view. This is illustrated by the cases of Jiang Qing and Ye Qun’s political roles being portrayed as mere mistakes, and the cases of Deng Yingchao’s public roles being seen as an extension of her domestic roles and extensive media attention being paid to Wu Yi’s private life. Since the last decade, however, there has been little difference between media representation of female and male politicians.

The authors argues that media representation of female politicians is a changing dynamic. In an authoritarian system, the changes can be caused by the varying needs of the dominant political party at different times. In the case of China, these are the needs of dealing with legitimacy crises, presenting a positive image to the outside world, and strengthening its centralized rule.

The Shanghai-based Grass Stage theater troupe performed versions of World Factory at various venues in China, Hong Kong, and North America from 2014-2016. World Factory, a non-narrative, experimental documentary-based production, considered China’s new working class from historical, subjective, psychic, and social perspectives. Performances were also venues for intense and heated discussion with the audience. 2016, as the character of the Xi Jinping regime became more and more clear, marked an apogee not only for the performance, but for the Chinese worker’s movement in general. This talk traces Grass Stage’s trajectory from World Factory to the present, and uses that trajectory as a diagnosis of the state of political subjectivity and the fate of social critique.

        BRINGING EMOTIONS INTO THE CITY: HISTORY AND HERITAGE

        Urban inhabitants have long had an emotional attachment to the cities they live in. This expresses itself through daily life, culture, and heritage. This talk highlights some of the ways in which urban populations in China have reflected on their emotional attachment to the city. Examples includehuaigupoetry mourning the loss of Luoyang, guidebooks that waxed lyrical on the sites of Ming Dynasty Nanjing, and emotional appeals to create socialist production cities in Maoist China.

Within this broader context of emotional attachment to place, one of the issues that inspires the most vigorous responses is heritage. Study of the protection, use, and development of heritage assets often focuses on their economic value and the local and broader politics around specific sites. However, to the people who are most attached to heritage, it is the emotional connection that is the most important. This talk explores examples from Hong Kong, such as the Star Ferry. It sets these in a global context by thinking about how emotional attachment to heritage is guiding urban policy and planning. As rapid urbanization sweeps all before it in skyscrapers of steel and glass, I ask whether prioritising an emotional approach to heritage has the potential to create cities that are more accessible, equitable, and sustainable.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

This program is a collaboration between theUS Heartland China AssociationandChina Institute in America.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
