        中国经济在改革开放后的前三十多年取得了举世瞩目的成就。但是，关于中国经济快速增长的原因却存在不同的解读。本讲座通过比较中国和东亚各国的发展经验，发现中国经济快速增长的原因在于 80 年代后期开始实行的出口导向工业化战略。这一战略的实施，不仅消除了长期制约中国经济增长的外汇瓶颈，也为中国企业参与国际分工提供了必要的条件，最大限度地发挥了中国廉价劳动力的优势。
中国之所以能够开始实行出口导向工业化战略，主要是由于中国从70 年代末就开始了局部的市场化、私有化改革和对外开放。计划体制和国有企业的改革、乡镇企业的发展、外资引进政策的实施为中国实施出口导向工业化提供了必要的制度基础。1994 年的财贸体制的改革，特别是汇率改革，使中国最终确立了出口导向工业化战略。2001 年加入 WTO 以后，以美国为代表的国际市场向中国全面开放，中国出口导向战略得以产生巨大效果。
中国特有的一些因素，如巨大的人口规模、计划生育政策、户籍制度、公有土地制度、政府强有力的动员能力、以及港澳台的存在等，也在一定程度上加快了中国经济的增长。但是，这些因素既不可复制，也难以推广，无法成为中国经济增长模式的核心内容。中国的快速增长是东亚模式的又一个典型案例。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道收看讲座。

        Like other major powers, China projects many kinds of influence abroad. Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has recently started highlighting the importance of promoting “foreign-related rule of law,” a new category of law that knits together Chinese and international law to govern China’s offshore activities. One place to look for foreign-related rule of law in action is in Chinese-invested overseas special economic zones, which some foreign scholars view as extraterritorial zones under Chinese power and law. NYU Shanghai Professor Maria Adele Carrai will discuss her research of selected Chinese overseas economic zones and new forms of Chinese extraterritoriality.

        As China and the U.S. increasingly compete for power in key areas of U.S. influence, great power conflict looms. Yet few studies have looked to the Middle East and Africa, regions of major political, economic, and military importance for both China and the U.S., to theorize how China competes in a changing world system.

China's Rise in the Global Southexamines China's behavior as a rising power in two key Global South regions, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. Dawn C. Murphy, drawing on extensive fieldwork and hundreds of interviews, compares and analyzes thirty years of China's interactions with these regions across a range of functional areas: political, economic, foreign aid, and military. From the Belt and Road initiative to the founding of new cooperation forums and special envoys, China's Rise in the Global South offers an in-depth look at China's foreign policy approach to the countries it considers its partners in South-South cooperation.

Intervening in the emerging debate between liberals and realists about China's future as a great power, Murphy contends that China is constructing an alternate international order to interact with these regions, and this book provides policymakers and scholars of international relations with the tools to analyze it.

C﻿opies of the book can be purchased fromStanford University Press.

Registration is free and open to the public.

This event will be recorded and will be available on the Sigur Center YouTube channel after the event.

        The growing economic and political relationships between China and the African continent in the past two decades are well documented in social science and policy studies. As Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt-and-Road initiative continues to expand China’ global reach, pushback has resulted from the spread of Covid-19 and African governments’ increasing debt to the Chinese government. These developments raise new geopolitical questions now that other parts of the world and China are “decoupling.” State actors continue to occupy analytical mindsets.

Siu complicates the land-based, state-centered conceptual frameworks by highlighting the historical legacies and contemporary fluidities that make up the life worlds of multi-ethnic stakeholders who have long traversed the continental divides. Based on ethnographic trips in Tanzania, the Gulf Region, South and Southeast Asia, Guangdong and Hong Kong, Siu uncovers crucial layers of maritime connections and explores how diverse human encounters, their nuanced cultural meanings and intense powerplay are expressed.

        Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s



Book Talk with Chien-Wen Kung (National University of Singapore) 



O﻿nline Event 



*﻿RSVP requested

The UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Chien-Wen Kung to discuss his newly published monograph, Diasporic Cold Warriors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Philippine Chinese were Southeast Asia and possibly the world’s most exemplary overseas Chinese Cold Warriors. Fears of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Southeast Asia’s Chinese as conduits for PRC influence gripped states and societies then – as indeed they do today. Yet, ironically, the example of the Philippines shows that the &quot;China&quot; which intervened the most extensively in any Southeast Asian country during the Cold War was not the PRC. It was, rather, the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. Drawing upon archival research and fieldwork in Taiwan, the Philippines, the United States, and China, Diasporic Cold Warriors tells for the first time this story of the Philippine Chinese as anticommunist partisans by tracing their evolving relationship with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Philippine state over the middle third of the 20th century.

Chien-Wen Kung is an Assistant Professor of History at the National University of Singapore and the author of Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s. His scholarship has also been published in Modern Asian Studies, the International History Review, and Asian Ethnicity. Born and raised in Singapore, he received his B.A. in History and English from Dartmouth College and Ph.D. in Modern Chinese and International and Global History from Columbia University. With funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and National Heritage Board in Singapore, he is currently working on a cultural history of Singapore-China-Taiwan relations in the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1946 Pandatsang Rapga was identified as a Kuomintang (KMT) spy by the British colonial administrators and deported from India. A member of the famous border-crossing trading family of the Pandatsangs based in Kalimpong (West Bengal, India), Rapga’s life in the 1940s was remarkably mobile and deeply intertwined with the political changes taking place in India, Tibet, and China. This presentation explores several issues associated with the identification of Rapga as a KMT spy in the context of cross-border mobility and intelligence gathering in colonial and postcolonial Asia. Examined alongside similarly mobile individuals, such as Raja Mahendra Pratap and Hisao Kimura, it addresses the issues of state suspicions over mobility and political networking and alliances, the surveillance infrastructure in border regions, and the materiality of information. The presentation also attempts to make methodological intervention in the use of archival material for studying mobile individuals.

        In this talk, Silvia Lindtner,Associate Professor in the School ofInformation andPenny W Stamps School of Art and Design at the Univesrity of Michiganwill draw from ethnographic research she has conducted over the last 14 months across two sites in China: 1) small-scale businesses that center on alternative food and spiritual practices via life in nature and the countryside and 2) large-scale, data-driven agricultural experiments at the outskirts of major urban centers. Prof. Lindtner will discuss how these two sites interact for the implementation of two recent state policies on “rural revitalization” and “national strengthening.” These policies are aimed at reinvesting into China’s “hinterlands:” from rural farmland to people’s most inner selves. They position data-driven techniques of automation, surveillance technology, and smart systems as key to the state’s ability to manage life that has partially escaped the state’s reach. And they call upon China’s youths who have turned away from the city to live and work in China’s countryside to co-produce what she calls “data engines,” i.e. a participatory form of techno-governance driven by an engineering mindset that aims to cultivate citizens as productive selves who operate on behalf of the party state and its ambition to build a “strong China” by turning inwards—China’s history, soil, and agriculture. Data engines, she shows, simultaneously enable, and slow down the automation of China’s soil and soul.

        The Sediq and Truku Indigenous peoples on the mountainous island of Formosa – today called Taiwan – say that their ancestors emerged in the beginning of time from Pusu Qhuni, a tree-covered boulder in the highlands. Living in the mountain forests, they observed the sacred law of Gaya, seeking equilibrium with other humans, the spirits, animals, and plants. They developed a politics in which each community preserved its autonomy and sharing was valued more highly than personal accumulation of goods or power. These lifeworlds were shattered by colonialism, capitalist development, and cultural imperialism in the twentieth century.

Based on two decades of ethnographic field research, Truly Human portrays these peoples’ lifeworlds, teachings, political struggles for recognition, and relations with non-human animals. Taking seriously their ontological claims that Gaya offers moral guidance to all humans, Scott E. Simon reflects on what this particular form of Indigenous resurgence reveals about human rights, sovereignty, and the good of all kind.

Scott Simon (University of Ottawa), is a socio-anthropologist trained in both disciplines (anthropology and sociology). Co-holder of the Chair of Taiwan Studies at the University of Ottawa, he has lived in Taiwan for ten years and returns annually for field research. His research interests include Indigenous rights, development, the contribution of Taiwan to the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan’s international status, and Canada-Taiwan relations. He has written four books and numerous articles about Taiwan.

This talk is grounded in two decades of fieldwork on the preservation of historical memory tabooed by the CCP regime. Drawing on contextualized personal accounts, Rowena He will illuminate the unequal contest between state-imposed interpretations of history and independent scholarship on China’s forbidden past, and their implications for nationalism, democratization, and the field of China studies. Highlighting her extensive interactions with local and mainland Chinese students during Hong Kong’s unprecedented social movement, she illustrates how memory becomes a form of resistance that embodies citizen autonomy and agency. The power of the powerless.

        Ready? Set, here we go again.

“Pathways” (Dao道) in classical Daoist discourses, not really “ready-made,” tend to make themselves anew quite readily, all the way through; “way-making (dao) that can be put into words,” “eloquently couched” as such (信言不美 美言不信Daodejing道德經CH 8), “is not really way-making” (道可道非常道), says the old sage (老子), who also says that “those who know will not say it, and those who say would not know it” (知者不言 言者不知).Whatis he saying?Daois effable and ineffable. So what? What are we supposed to do?

Today, which GPS will take us to this Daoist “door of all wonders” (衆妙)? What kind of thresholding, not just gatekeeping, would be possible? Taking the auto-poetic generativity of such good old Daoist paradoxes and ironies as a philosophically renewable energy, this seminar, the first in the series, on the Daoist PhiloPoetics of transitive ambiguation introduces ways to rebootLaozi(老子) andZhuangzi(庄子) translingually, focusing on their metamorphic — metaphorical and metaphysical — avant-gardism, their waiting (weiding未定Zhuangzi04) game.

Using 'big data' computational techniques to scrutinize cases covering 2009–2016 from all 252 basic-level courts in two Chinese provinces, Henan and Zhejiang,Ethan Michelsonreveals that women have borne the brunt of a dramatic intensification since the mid-2000s of a decades-long practice of denying divorce requests. This talk discusses key findings from his new book of the same name. Michelson's analysis of almost 150,000 divorce trials reveals routine and egregious violations of China's own laws upholding the freedom of divorce, gender equality, and the protection of women's physical security. Michelson takes the reader upstream to the institutional sources of China's clampdown on divorce and downstream to its devastating and highly gendered human toll, showing how judges in an overburdened court system clear their oppressive dockets at the expense of women's lawful rights and interests

Cameron Campbellwill give a talk based on his historical database. He will present findings on the social origins, qualifications, and career dynamics of 19th century Qing civil officials that support, complicate and contradict the assumptions and stylized facts about the selection and promotion of officials that underpin much recent quantitative research on Qing social, economic, and political history. The findings are drawn from the ongoing analysis of the China Government Employee Dataset-Qing (CGED-Q) which the Lee-Campbell Group began to construct in 2014.

        Dr Andrew Chubb of Lancaster University will be joining us to discuss the causes and consequences of South China Sea nationalism.

In this talk, Dr Chubb will expand on research which traces the rise of Chinese popular nationalist attitudes and actions towards the South China Sea disputes. Extensive literature on nationalism in contemporary China has generally concentrated on its manifestations in relation to Japan, the United States, or the “West” in general. While this is understandable given the prominence of former imperialist powers as foils for China’s contemporary state-sanctioned national identity, it has left a dearth of accounts of Chinese nationalism in relation to its Southeast Asian neighbors. This talk will analyse original 2013 survey data on urban residents’ perceptions of the South China Sea dispute, internet search activity data stretching back to 2006, and quasi-ethnographic observation of online discourse. The analysis shows, first, that Beijing’s more confrontational policy in the South China Sea was a key cause of intensified Chinese public sentiments on the issue. This largely unintended effect generated significant new challenges to the party-state’s control of public opinion. The case shows how the Internet reduced the CCP propaganda state’s ability to frame domestic interpretations of foreign policy developments, but retains decisive agenda-setting influence over the issue’s salience. These findings provide theoretical insight into the causes of nationalism and the socio-political consequences of network technology under authoritarian regimes.

With the recent reform of household registration system (hukou) in China, equalizing welfare benefits and public services among all Chinese citizens regardless of their hukou status has been the goal and direction of social welfare provision. However, migrants in the urban cities are still living on the periphery and faced with various barriers to access welfare benefits and services. This study argues that, despite the reform of the hukou registration, the conflict between the universal rights of all citizens in a society and the limited resources for welfare provision in a particular place will continue to exist. Consequently, the compromise between the rights and resources would create a threshold that defines a set of eligibility criteria to decide who are included/excluded from enjoying the benefits. It proposes a new conceptual construct, welfare boundary, to delineate such a compromised threshold. Taking into account migrants’ subjective experiences of welfare access, it further identifies two forms of welfare boundary: institutional (derived from policies) and perceptional (derived from migrants’ own experiences). Drawing upon qualitative data collected in southern China where a great many migrants are concentrated, this study elaborates on the two forms of welfare boundary through understanding from the migrants’ own perspectives that how welfare boundary is defined, where welfare boundary exists, how it is manifested, perceived and experienced by migrants and their families, and how they cope and negotiate with the welfare boundaries. This research contributes to our understanding of China’s current mobility regime characterized by differential inclusion in the context of ongoing reform and development.

        The King’s Road offers a new interpretation of the history of the Silk Road, emphasizing its importance as a diplomatic route, rather than a commercial one. Tracing the arduous journeys of diplomatic envoys, Xin Wen presents a rich social history of long-distance travel that played out in deserts, post stations, palaces, and polo fields. The book tells the story of the everyday lives of diplomatic travelers on the Silk Road—what they ate and drank, the gifts they carried, and the animals that accompanied them—and how they navigated a complex web of geographic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. It also describes the risks and dangers envoys faced along the way—from financial catastrophe to robbery and murder. Using documents unearthed from the famous Dunhuang “library cave” in Western China, The King’s Road paints a detailed picture of the intricate network of trans-Eurasian transportation and communication routes that was established between 850 and 1000 CE.

By exploring the motivations of the kings who dispatched envoys along the Silk Road and describing the transformative social and economic effects of their journeys, the book reveals the inner workings of an interstate network distinct from the Sino-centric “tributary” system. In shifting the narrative of the Silk Road from the transport of commodities to the exchange of diplomatic gifts and personnel, The King’s Road puts the history of Eastern Eurasia in a new light.

        China Engineers, Ltd. (信昌機器工程公司) was a hybrid company founded in 1928 by the Eurasian entrepreneur William Charles Gomersall (1895 – 1960). It was registered according to the Hong Kong ordinances, but its main economic activity took place in its branch office in Shanghai. Besides being major shareholder, Gomersall was elected director for life, while the company mixed Chinese and British partners. Between 1928 and 1936, China Engineers became an important provider of textile machinery to Chinese industrialists, who thrived in Shanghai and the surrounding cities. However, when the war against Japan clashed in July 1937, the industrial machinery trade reached a standstill and China Engineers had to look for alternative activities to survive. This is a part of a book project about the business history of China Engineers, from 1928 to 1972. It will deal with the wartime period and profit from the archives found in Shanghai and Hong Kong as well as the private diary of William Charles Gomersall. The long war strengthened the ties between the company and the Chinese entrepreneurs from one side, and the British government from the other, facilitating transfers of capital and machinery between Shanghai and Hong Kong, especially in the postwar period.

        Prof Christopher Rea will join us in-person to discuss the intersection of Chinese cinema &amp;amp; digital humanities. Book you free ticket now!

How can we use digital platforms—including social media—to enhance research and learning on modern China? How can we make the “obscure” (to non-specialists) discoverable? What are the expected and unexpected results of making an audiovisual archive public, as measured by views, comments, likes, or GoogleAnalytics data? And what happens when your book project morphs into a multi-platform digital extravaganza?

This presentation will share discoveries from the first few years of the Chinese Film Classics Project (chinesefilmclassics.org), an ongoing international effort to make early Chinese cinema history more accessible to the English-speaking world. Christopher Rea will speak about his experiences building an online course while writing his book Chinese Film Classics, 1922-1949 (2021), and how he worked with collaborators to create a free digital archive of early Chinese films with English translations. He will illustrate the talk with examples of “playlist pedagogy,” including curatorial techniques that highlight significant features of Chinese films, from songs to scenes to special effects. The presentation will also showcase sights and scenes from Chinese films of the “pre-Code,” WWII, and Civil War eras.

        Conflicts over specific rules lie at the heart of the narrative of China's island disputes with its neighbors in the East and South China Seas. But the main contest concerns the strategic waters associated with those islands. To consolidate control over this vital maritime space, China's leadershave begun to enforce &quot;China's Law of the Sea&quot; by building domestic legal institutions, bureaucratic organizations, and a naval and maritime law enforcement apparatus that overmatches regionalchallengers and imposes costs on navalpowers around the globe. Dr. Kardon and Dr. Dutton will explore questions such as, will states choose to acquiesce to China's preferences? Will there be conflict? Or will states find peaceful ways to overcome China's challenge to the international maritime order?Use discount code: Y23Kardon for 30% off Dr. Kardon’s new book, China’s Law of the Sea: The New Rules of Maritime Order (Yale University Press, 2023).

Moderator:Kristina Dy-Liacco, Tibetan Studies Librarian, Starr East Asian Library, Columbia University

With a career spanning 47 years at the Library of Congress, Susan Meinheit has had a pioneering role in the development, management, and conservation of the Library of Congress' vast Tibetan collection, one of the largest in the world. From her first LC position as a library clerk, it was through her area and language expertise -- combined with sheer determination -- that she essentially carved out her role as steward and champion of LC's long-neglected early TIbetan holdings which were based on the collections of three major scholars of Tibet and southwest China and acquired by LC in the early 1900s. Meinheit will talk about the early history of the collection; the growth of the collection through the PL-480 Books program with India, and achievements in bringing wider visibility of the Tibetan holdings through major cataloging and digitization initiatives.

        As China opened up its economy over the past four decades, conventional wisdom held that the country’s growing embrace of free markets would lead to a more liberal society. Instead, China’s unprecedented economic growth has positioned state capitalism as a durable foil to the orthodoxy of free markets, to the confusion of many in the West. Xi Jinping was recently appointed to a third five-year term as China’s supreme leader, and has increasingly doubled down on state control of the economy and many have commented on his renewed embrace of Maoist principles. What does this mean for the future of the Chinese economy and relations with the West? What are the implications of China returning to some of the ideological principles spearheaded by Mao Zedong? And how much of China’s decades of economic success can be credited to Mao and Maoism?

Christopher Marquis will discuss his new book, Mao and Markets (Yale University Press, 2023) which examines these questions and charts how Mao’s ideological principles, mass campaigns, and socialist institutions have enduringly influenced Chinese entrepreneurs, listed companies and provincial and city politicians.

        With China’s tacit support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been much talk in global media about a new China-Russia alliance against the West. This has been supported by evidence of military cooperation, such as joint naval drills in the East China Sea in December 2022, as well as Xi Jinping’s advocacy of an authoritarian “Beijing model” as an ideological and political alternative to the “Washington consensus”. But China and Russia have a long history of conflict as well, from imperial Russian aggressions against Qing China, to the Sino-Soviet split during the Cold War.

So what are the prospects for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century? How do mainland Chinese view Russia? We are joined by four scholars currently working on different aspects of China-Russia relations:


	Ed Pulford, Lecturer in Chinese Studies, Manchester (Chinese views of Putin; Sino-Russian friendship);
	Elena Barabantseva, Senior Lecturer in Politics, Manchester (male Chinese views of Russian and Ukrainian women);

        In this talk, India China Institute’s Postdoctoral Fellow Sarandha Jain will discuss her PhD dissertation, which studies the oil-mediated relationship between the Indian state and citizens. Focusing on both oil production and consumption, presenting ethnography of oil refineries, research institutes, state offices, a peri-urban working-class-neighborhood near Delhi, and ‘black markets’, her talk examines oil as an infrastructure for the state and for society. She argues that the Indian state distributes itself into citizens’ lives via petroleum products, which obtain their sociopolitical agencies while being produced in certain ways, and play out those agencies while being consumed in certain ways. Her ethnography of refineries details out the microprocesses of oil refining and the complex relationship that human and nonhuman actors share. It elaborates on how politics get programmed into petroleum products, designed to discipline consumer-citizens into particular lifestyles, and how varying actors encumber this. Research on oil consumption with ‘black-marketeers’ and ordinary consumers of petroleum products, probes “distorted discipline”, where governmental plans get mangled by the informal practices of state actors as well as citizens. How does the politics programmed into petroleum products in refineries actually play out once other actors intervene, and snatch control over oil away from the state? Investigating this tussle between legalized and illegalized groups, she describes how it structures citizens’ lives, and the constellations of power and forms of sociality it gives rise to. This talk highlights the constant churning between the state and citizens through ever-evolving devices of government, as well as through escape from them. Specific modes of subjectification, engineered through flows of oil, lie at the heart of this churning, over which state-citizen formations are negotiated.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	Relationships with bureaucracies, commercial counterparts and civil society in host countries
	
	Communist party influence on organisational structure, style of operating and incentive and penalties for employees.
	
	How Chinese companies manage the complexities of operating in international environments including language, host country markets, unfamiliar political systems, and cultural milieus as well as with competition from other commercial entities.
