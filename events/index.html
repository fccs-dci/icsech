        BRINGING EMOTIONS INTO THE CITY: HISTORY AND HERITAGE

        Urban inhabitants have long had an emotional attachment to the cities they live in. This expresses itself through daily life, culture, and heritage. This talk highlights some of the ways in which urban populations in China have reflected on their emotional attachment to the city. Examples includehuaigupoetry mourning the loss of Luoyang, guidebooks that waxed lyrical on the sites of Ming Dynasty Nanjing, and emotional appeals to create socialist production cities in Maoist China.

Within this broader context of emotional attachment to place, one of the issues that inspires the most vigorous responses is heritage. Study of the protection, use, and development of heritage assets often focuses on their economic value and the local and broader politics around specific sites. However, to the people who are most attached to heritage, it is the emotional connection that is the most important. This talk explores examples from Hong Kong, such as the Star Ferry. It sets these in a global context by thinking about how emotional attachment to heritage is guiding urban policy and planning. As rapid urbanization sweeps all before it in skyscrapers of steel and glass, I ask whether prioritising an emotional approach to heritage has the potential to create cities that are more accessible, equitable, and sustainable.

        The U.S.-Asia Law Institute kicks off its 2024-2025 programs by taking a close look at a problem right here at home: racial profiling of Asian Americans, including at universities. During the Trump administration, the Department of Justice created the China Initiative, a program presented as safeguarding universities and businesses from economic espionage. In practice, it raised widespread concerns of racial profiling of Chinese American and immigrant academics and researchers, many of whom were accused of failing to disclose routine academic activities – but not of espionage or national security breaches. Although the program ended in 2022, there are ongoing efforts to revive it. The Asian American Scholar Forum (AASF), a new civil rights advocacy organization created in response to the China Initiative, reports that Asian American and Asian researchers and scholars continue to face bias and heightened scrutiny in their working and living environments. AASF Executive Director Gisela Perez Kusakawa will discuss the current challenges faced by Asian American and Asian researchers, scholars, and students, the chilling effect this has, and the need for legal scholars to help develop innovative solutions to the tensions between national security and American values.

        In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing, has enabled large-scale quantitative analysis of historical texts, thus thereby making it possible to systematically investigate the minds of past generations. This talk will present two cases showcasing the application of AI models in historical research. Employing generative large language models, the first case uses AI agents to reenact intellectual debates in Chinese history. The second case uses embedding models to quantify psychological constructs in historical texts and explores the evolution of cultural psychology in premodern China over the course of two millennia.

        What roles did Americans play in the expanding global empires of the nineteenth century? Thomas M. Larkin examines the Hong Kong–based Augustine Heard &amp;amp; Company, the most prominent American trading firm in treaty-port China, to explore the ways American elites at once made and were made by British colonial society. Following the Heard brothers throughout their firm’s rise and decline, The China Firm reveals how nineteenth-century China’s American elite adapted to colonial culture, helped entrench social and racial hierarchies, and exploited the British imperial project for their own profit as they became increasingly invested in its political affairs and commercial networks.

Through the central narrative of Augustine Heard &amp;amp; Co., Larkin disentangles the ties that bound the United States to China and the British Empire in the nineteenth century. Drawing on a vast range of archival material from Hong Kong, China, Boston, and London, he weaves the local and the global together to trace how Americans gained acceptance into and contributed to the making of colonial societies and world-spanning empires. Uncovering the transimperial lives of these American traders and the complex ways extraimperial communities interacted with British colonialism, The China Firm makes a vital contribution to global histories of nineteenth-century Asia and provides an alternative narrative of British empire.

Theatre as Business: A study of the Triangular Relations among Shanxi Merchants’ business, Theatre Sponsorship and Social Status in Late Imperial China.

Shanxi merchants were one of the most powerful merchant groups that rose in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). In the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the late Qing in particular, Shanxi merchants’ business reached its peak. They dominated the market in northern China and established the first banking industry in the country. Apart from their enormous fortune, Shanxi merchants were also famous for their passion for xiqu and for their generous support to Shanxi regional theatre, especially clapper opera or bangzi 梆子. Shanxi merchants established stages in their guildhalls and mansions, invited Shanxi local troupes to perform at bustling market towns during their meetings and social gatherings, and entertained social elites with theatrical performances from time to time.

China was historically an agricultural society where literati ranked at the top of the traditional Chinese social hierarchy, while merchants were placed at the bottom, according to Confucian and Legalist ethos. This presentation reveals that the underlying reason for Shanxi merchants’ theatre sponsorship was their pursuit of wealth, influence, fame and higher social status. Theatre sponsorship helped Shanxi merchants achieve business success, maintain a close relationship with the ruling class, and obtain and manifest their newly acquired higher status.

This presentation also shows a divergence of opinions on the primary intention of merchants’ consumption of cultural products and engagement in cultural activities, which was social emulation by nature. The once-popular idea ‘merchants as déclassé and scholars as exalted’ came to be held by the literati alone and was a futile defence that merchants did not care much about at the dusk of the imperial era.

        On January 22, 2023, less than 24 hours after the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Los Angeles County, major news sources reported conflicting information about the 72-year old shooter, Huu Can Tran: that he was “an immigrant from China” (CNN) yet “born in Vietnam” (NY Times). Two months later, Ke Huy Quan, who graduated from a high school in the neighboring city of Alhambra, won an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Asian and Asian American netizens and news outlets began to claim and debate whether Quan was Chinese or Vietnamese, with one outlet opting for “Vietnamese-born”.

This talk looks at how Vietnamese, Taiwanese and U.S. policies affected ethnic Chinese first in, and later, from southern Vietnam (“Hoa”) and Hoa reactions to these policies. I first look at the Republic of Vietnam’s “Vietnamization” policies (1955-1975) which attempted to “assimilate” (đồng-hóa/同化) the Hoa as fully-fledged Vietnamese nationals of a new postcolonial nation-state. I then reconstruct Taiwan’s role in the IndoChinese refugee crisis. As a non-UN member state by the peak of the crisis in the late 1970s, Taiwan’s contributions to the IndoChinese refugee crisis are not recorded in UNHCR statistics, which detail the global nature of resettlement (across the “Global North”). Many Hoa resettled in the United States, where their experiences in Vietnam were reconfigured in a new racial/ethnic landscape. By observing one ethnic community over half a century, my talk seeks to transpacificize across Critical Refugee, Southeast Asian, East Asian, Asian American/diasporic, and Cold War studies.

        State-building in conflict-prone societies faces the challenge of autonomous armed groups. We argue that military centralization, while strengthening a state’s ability to control the upper elites of these armed groups, can weaken the state's coercive capacity by reducing discipline and efficiency among the lower ranks in these groups. This talk studies a centralization reform in China’s Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), and finds that centralization reduced rebellions by local generals but led to more mutinies in the lower ranks of the military, more civilian uprisings, and worse battlefield performance. These findings highlight the complex effects of military centralization on the state’s coercive capacity, often overlooked in political science. (Co-author: Joy Chen)

        &quot;GOOD WIFE, WISE MOTHER”: ASSIMILATING HAN TAIWANESE UNDER JAPANESE RULE

        &quot;Good Wife, Wise Mother”: Assimilating Han Taiwanese Under Japanese Rule

In 1897, two years after Japan began its half-century rise as an imperial power, it inaugurated an ambitious experiment to make modern Japanese citizens out of Han Taiwanese schoolgirls in its first overseas colony, Taiwan. The goal of the segregated education was to train Taiwanese boys and men to become government clerks and teachers, and girls and women to become “good wives, wise mothers” (ryōsai kenbo). This gendered education was part of dōka, the Japanese assimilation program, as it sought to make everyone in the empire “Japanese” as equals by teaching the Japanese language and imperial ethics with gendered roles. Constructed by engaging with the cult of domesticity in the West that envisioned the home as a private space for women and the workplace as a public space for men to build strong nation-states, “good wife, wise mother” emerged in Japan in the 1890s and was introduced to Taiwan in the same decade.

Using periodicals and Japanese language textbooks, I examine the discourse and implementation of this ideal womanhood in Taiwan. This ideal of womanhood was crucial to the civilizing mission of the colonizers. Japanese colonial authority used gender to increase the supposed distance of civilizational levels between the colonizer and the colonized. By introducing gender into the discussion on dōka in Taiwan, I show that the promise of equality and inclusion from dōka became even less attainable and thus slowed assimilation to the supposedly superior Japanese civilization when colonial officials and educators characterized the colonized as feminine and depicted colonized women as the symbol of Taiwan’s “backwardness.”

Gendered assimilation became almost attainable for the Taiwanese toward the end of World War II compared to the pre-war dōka efforts. Ethnic and class divisions were blurred during wartime mobilization as the colonial government expanded the responsibilities of schoolgirls and women, thus blurring the distinction between Taiwanese and Japanese. Wartime mobilization redefined gendered assimilation in colonial Taiwan, as it shifted the training and focus of “good wives, wise mothers”, from the individual households only, to the entire empire, which meant that schoolgirls were trained to become “good wives, wise mothers” of the empire.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

        This study is based on a database encompassing all instances of political succession in imperial China, constructed by the speaker from a large collection of historical sources. The analysis reveals that only half of the designated successors in the two millennia of imperial Chinese history successfully ascended to power. These divergent outcomes are best explained by the age of the ruling monarch, the age gap between the ruling monarch and the designated successor, and the presence or absence of powerful officials at court. These findings the conventional wisdom that uses primogeniture to explain political succession and instead emphasizes the influence of non-institutional factors.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
