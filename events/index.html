        Is China a “rogue donor” that uses its largesse to prop up corrupt and authoritarian regimes? Does Beijing bankroll politically motivated and economically inefficient ‘‘white elephants”? What are the risks of borrowing from Beijing? The existing debate about China’s overseas lending and grant-giving activities is largely guided by opinion and conjecture rather than rigorous evidence. In this talk, Dr. Parks will set the record straight with a new dataset of international development finance from China that captures 13,427 projects worth $843 billion across 165 countries over an 18-year period.

        Recent years have seen intensifying US coalition-building efforts among partners and allies to address common concerns about the People’s Republic of China. This has moved beyond classic military balancing in Asia to focus on the economic, technological and ideological dimensions of competition and rivalry with China, in the process bringing a different cluster of states ‒ particularly in Europe ‒ to the fore in US China strategy. The PRC has also been rebalancing its own approach to partners and quasi-allies, moving beyond its traditional non-alignment to deepen ties with states that can offer advantages to China in its contest with the United States. This development is exemplified by the Sino-Russian joint statement of February 2022 and recent shifts to China’s global military basing plans. The talk will explore how the new form of ‘systemic rivalry’ came about, and how the war in Ukraine is affecting its trajectory, offering a preview of the speaker’s forthcoming book on the subject.

AndrewSmallis a senior transatlantic fellow with GMF's Asia Program, whichhe established in 2006. His research focuses on US–China relations, Europe–China relations, Chinese policy in South Asia, and broader developments in China's foreign and economic policy.

        Abstract

Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since independence, which has left the country unable to buy enough fuel, with people facing an acute scarcity of food and basic necessities. The anti-government protesters in Sri Lanka have rallied against a downward spiralling economy that has exhausted Sri Lankan foreign reserves. In the form of infrastructure loans, the Chinese economic footprint in the country has aided the lopsided economic reforms in draining the public finances. In addition to the economic downfall, the political instability in the country has not allowed the situation to improve either. Even as Ranil Wickremesinghe took oath as the new Prime Minister of Sri Lanka the people are still demanding the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Sri Lankans are not hopeful of Wickremesinghe to be able to reverse the economic mismanagement by successive governments over the last few years. Amid another humanitarian crisis in India’s neighbourhood, the country is trying to put in serious efforts to aid political stability and economic recovery. The fluid situation of Sri Lanka will be discussed along with responses by India and China as their assistance can lead to setting a precedent for the future role the two countries will play in South Asian geopolitics.

        China today seems caught in a contradiction: a capitalist state led by a Communist party. But as Jason Kelly shows inMarket Maoists, this seeming paradox is nothing new. Since the 1930s, before the Chinese Communist Party came to power, Communist traders and diplomats have sought deals with capitalists in an effort to fuel political transformation and the restoration of Chinese power. For as long as there have been Communists in China, they have been reconciling revolutionary aspirations at home with market realities abroad.

Jason Kelly unearths this hidden history of global commerce, finding that even Mao Zedong saw no fundamental conflict between trading with capitalists and chasing revolution. China’s ties to capitalism transformed under Mao but were never broken. And it was not just goods and currencies that changed hands. Sustained contact with foreign capitalists shaped the Chinese nation under Communism and left deep impressions on foreign policy. Deals demanded mutual intelligibility and cooperation. As a result, international transactions facilitated the exchange of ideas, habits, and beliefs, leaving subtle but lasting effects on the values and attitudes of individuals and institutions.

Drawing from official and commercial archives around the world, including newly available internal Chinese Communist Party documents,Market Maoistsrecasts our understanding of China’s relationship with global capitalism, revealing how these early accommodations laid the groundwork for China’s embrace of capitalism in the 1980s and after.

Trade has for some time been recognized as a major strategic parameter in international relations. China and the United States are, alongside the EU, economic giants that for some time have had a fraught relationship of both rivalry and co-dependence. ASEAN has found itself caught in the middle, walking a delicate diplomatic tightrope while trying to play a bridging role to maintain international stability essential for the well-being of all stakeholders.

How closely aligned are China and Russia? Why won’t China condemn Putin’s Ukraine war? How to define and measure strategic alignments between states? This book talk for China-Russia Strategic Alignment in International Politics (Amsterdam University Press, 2022) bridges area studies and International Relations theory to answer these questions. Post-Cold War China-Russia strategic cooperation has developed significantly and become an increasingly important factor in international politics. However, there has been no theory-grounded framework and corresponding measurements that would allow an accurate and systematic assessment of the level of China-Russia alignment and its progress over time. This book develops a set of objective criteria to measure and explain the development of strategic alignment in post-Cold War China-Russia relations. The book establishes that on a range of criteria, China-Russia alignment has been moving towards a full-fledged alliance, showing a consistent incremental upward trend. There are strong structural incentives for furthering the China-Russia alignment and the war in Ukraine is unlikely to change that trend. The alignment framework developed in the book can be applied to other cases of interstate strategic cooperation to facilitate cross-country comparisons.

        SINO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS IN HISTORIC CONTEXT: IDEOLOGY, AGENCY AND INTERESTS

        Sino-Russian relations have always had a deep impact on both countries, and the rise and fall of their alliance during the Cold War even significantly shaped the history of Xi’s own family. In this talk, Professor Joseph Torigian will compare that earlier era of the relationship to the present day across three issue areas. First, although the two countries are no longer tied by Marxist ideology, they share a distaste for western democracy and a hope that the world will become safer for authoritarian regimes. Second, during the Cold War, China’s use of force often led to tensions with the USSR – now, it is Russia’s aggressive behavior that stresses the relationship. Third, the Putin-Xi friendship is an anomaly in the history of the relationship, as previous leaders often mistrusted or disrespected one another. An appreciation for these differences suggests that although the relationship is not as close as it was at the height of the Sino-Soviet alliance and that neither side will fully sacrifice its interests for the other, in some ways the relationship today is better capable of managing centrifugal forces.

Thursday, June 16 2022, 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM ET

Throughout its history, ASEAN has been diplomatically adept in refusing to take sides on a wide range of geo-political issues that divide the US and its allies in the Global North (like Japan) and China and its allies (including many in the Global South). Since February 2022, as demonstrated by votes at the UN General Assembly and virtually daily announcements from governments in response to Ukraine’s pleas for assistance, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has put pressure on states to align with one side or the other in what could become new global blocs reminiscent of the Cold War. How does the new world disorder affect ASEAN’s diplomatic stance and its security goals and strategies?

        THE “NEW” AND “OLD” IN XI JINPING AS A CHINESE LEADER

        Xi Jinping is often described as a fundamentally new kind of leader in Chinese politics – one who has ended a tradition of collective leadership and returned to a Maoist ideological agenda. While those two conventional views have some truth to them, they do not fully grasp the complexities of Chinese elite politics or the role of ideology in today’s China. The CCP has always been an extraordinarily leader-friendly system, and claims that Xi is rejecting Deng Xiaoping’s institutionalist leadership model do not reflect the new historiography on Deng’s tenure as China’s leader. And although Xi Jinping clearly believes that only devotion and conviction among party members can save the CCP, his experiences under the Mao era suggest a distaste and skepticism for radical politics. Xi’s approach to ideology indicates the pursuit of both a new and middle path: one that tries to maintain the economic vitality of Reform and Opening while drawing selectively upon an earlier era to address the challenges those years of economic reform have brought to regime stability. And given the nature of the CCP as a system in which power tends to flow down, not up, it is highly unlikely that a coalition within the elite will force a course correction.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
