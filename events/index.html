        In the history of medicine and health, the barefoot doctor scheme in China during the Cultural Revolution was a synonym for the provision of rural health care in the Maoist era. This talk examines how socio-political, disease, and economic factors contributed to the development of the barefoot doctor program and shaped the unique path of health provision in China over the past seven decades. It analyses how the government clarified and addressed the contradiction between ideological equity and structural inequity. It discusses how epidemiologic transition both facilitated and challenged the barefoot doctor program. The talk further investigates how the changing roles and function of barefoot doctors has impacted the evolution of community medicine since the late 1960s. It discusses how the barefoot doctors echoed the themes of social medicine in developing and developed countries and left its inspirations and legacies. By revisiting the state’s role in the barefoot doctor program, this research aims to contribute to a new understanding of the global history of medicine and health in the twentieth century and beyond when socio-politics, epidemiologic transition, and medical technology shaped social determinants of health and the relationship between medicine and politics in China.

        This talk tells the story of Dragon Lady Traders, a US-based company established by Veronica Yhap in the early 1970s that imported clothing from China. Yhap’s experiences highlight the challenges and contingencies of US-China trade relations after 20 years of Cold War isolation. But they also reveal the importance of both the textile industry and Hong Kong to China’s reintegration with global capitalism.

        The talk will attempt to prove the hypothesis that China’s aggressive action on the Northern Borders is connected to its global confrontation with the US and its allies. The methodology adopted would be based on interrogation of China’s use of the military instrument in the Northern Borders with a view to establish a connection with its political objectives. Identifying the politico-strategic context within a regional and global framework, is expected to facilitate the identification of vectors that could indicate the contours of its political objectives. It is therefore being argued that China is using the Northern Border to create ‘pinch points’ that can exert pressure on India’s military capabilities so as to draw India’s military and political energy, keep India confined to the Sub-continent and slow down its growth as a maritime power. This becomes clear in the context of China’s vulnerabilities, the criticality of securing of its trade routes in the Indo-Pacific and especially in the Indian Ocean, that is a strategic concern in the context of a growing confrontation with the US and its Allies. Keeping India from shifting its strategic weight towards the US in the larger global geopolitical confrontation could be the prime objective. China therefore would have no intention to either restore the status quo on the Northern Border nor respect the earlier agreements. It would continue to negotiate sporadically and could intermittently activate ‘pinch points’ at any place along the Northern Border as a provocative response to what it sees as the growing proximity between India, the US and its allies.

- Abstract: Long before Zhang Qian 張騫 (d. 114 BCE) made his celebrated trip through Central Asia, people were passing back and forth along the entire breadth of Eurasia. Chinese silk has been found woven into the air of a female mummy from Egypt dating to about 1000 BCE. On the other hand, there is evidence of the knowledge of—if not necessarily—the physical presence of Egyptian-style papyrus in China about the same time. Other examples of contact across Eurasia include horse-drawn chariots from no later than 1200 BCE down to the pyramids covering tombs in the mid-Warring States period and even the statues of soldiers near the tomb of Qin Shihuang (d. 210 BCE). In this talk, I will present comparisons of these types of artifacts on either end of what would become the Silk Roads.

        The geopolitics of the twenty-first century is increasingly characterized by a transformation of world order. In recent decades, the liberal international order, underpinned since the end of the Cold War by unipolar American hegemony, has been fundamentally destabilized by the rise of emerging powers across the global South – a process spearheaded by China and by organizational formations such as the BRICS. Economically, this process is fuelled by the ascent of dynamic growth centres beyond the Euro-American core of the world-system, and manifest in apparent departures from the policy orthodoxies of market liberalism. In the realm of global governance, southern emerging powers have unsettled the workings of the extant multilateral system and begun crafting an alternative architecture for multilateralism through institutions such as the New Development Bank.

How do we understand the nature of the political regimes driving this transformation of world order? This is an urgent question, especially considering deepening trajectories of autocratization across states in the global South. In India, for example, Narendra Modi and the increasingly authoritarian right-wing Hindu nationalist BJP government preside over an unprecedented trajectory of attack on democratic institutions and freedoms. Moreover, under Xi Jinping, China’s intensification of authoritarianism in its one-party state has been concomitant with the rollout of ambitious challenges to the liberal global order, through initiatives on “Global Development” and “Global Security.” And in South Africa, the erosion of the ANC’s post-apartheid hegemony has opened up space for the crystallization of a new right-wing populism grounded in xenophobic conceptions of nationhood and belonging. In this panel, we interrogate the significance and implications of the entangled unfolding of illiberal politics and transformation of world order for understanding the nature of our current turbulent conjuncture.

- Abstract: Professor Chen Zhi’sFrom Ritualization to Secularization: The Shaping of the Book of Songstakes palaeography and linguistics as its starting points and draws in focus on musical archaeology and ethnomusicology. It makes fresh explanation of the multi-faceted origins and historical evolution ofThe Book of Songsin all their aspects. The compilation ofThe Book of Songsstems from conflict and compromise between Shang and Zhou culture, which experienced a complex and lengthy journey from ritualization to secularization and from standardization to regionalization.
Taking inspiration from the process of translating from Chinese into Japanese, Professor Yoshinobu Yuki, in addition to introducing how to deal with issues including those of cultural adaption, will also discuss how historically the Japanese have treated Chinese culture and characters, and in the future, how matters of cultural exchange between the Japanese and Chinese could be addressed.

Lecture 3: The Early Development of Metallurgy in China and Its Connections with the Eurasian Steppe冶金術在中國的早期發展及其與歐亞草原的聯繫

- Abstract: Were metallurgical technologies homegrown or did they come into China from outside? This question has consistently received the scrutiny of archaeologists and metallurgists. From the 1940s to the present, discussion has ebbed and flowed but reaching a definitive conclusion has proved difficult. Archaeological finds in recent years have furnished new evidence supporting a Chinese origin and outlined subsequent early developments, as well as providing new perspectives from which to view the issue and new avenues to investigate. Grounded in these discoveries, this paper devises a roadmap for systematic exploration and analysis of a proposed Chinese origin and its early development but considers that the weight of archaeological evidence still supports the view that metallurgical technologies entered China from the Eurasian steppe.
This paper focuses on the following three issues: 1. The advent of Old-World metallurgical technologies and their diffusion across the Eurasian steppe; 2. The excavation of early bronze artifacts and vestigial evidence of smelting and casting in northwest China; and 3. The development of early Chinese metallurgical technologies and their link to cultures of the Eurasian steppe. It considers that in the third millennium BCE, manufactured metal artifacts entered northwestern China from the Eurasian steppe, and relevant metallurgical technologies followed in their wake, and furthermore that in approximately the early second millennium BCE, they began a process of transformation into an indigenous practice. Subsequently, metallurgical technologies continued their diffusion eastwards entering north China and the central plains. This process of indigenous evolution gathered pace, especially given the stimulus of systems of Chinese ritual practice, leading to the formulation of a uniquely individual technology of composite earthenware mould casting, which in one fell swoop established a foundation for the magnificent culture of bronze artifacts of the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

        The age-old challenge of food security used to be dominated by concisely-defined national and international policies for agriculture, hunger eradication, food distribution, and safety nets for emergencies. The older field is being reshaped in the 21st century with the convergence of climate change, biotechnology, geopolitics, and a political economy that contends with a dominance of multinational corporations. The new landscape demands more capacious frameworks for understanding food security—frameworks that simultaneously contend with local, national, and international measures; integrate environmental, animal, and human health; and bring into conversation the political economy of poverty eradication with climate change. Indeed, the Ukraine-Russia war vividly illustrates the need for more capacious frameworks for conceptualizing food security. The war has had a direct impact on food supplies and prices but also subsequently on debt and inflation worldwide, especially in the poorest countries. 

Panelists will take on the challenge of deliberating on frameworks for food security by discussing the state of global food security; China’s and India’s domestic food security policies; and the influence of China and India on global institutions such as the Food and Agricultural Organization.

Lecture 2: The Fates of the Last Rulers of the Warring States
2023/10/13 │ 16:00 – 17:30
It has been argued that we know little about what happened to these rulers with the exception of the famous story of Heir Dan of Yan. Yet Han-dynasty texts like the Shiji and the Han shu as well as the accounts in the Zizhi tongjian and Ming and Qing literary works reveal much about these royal clans and their descendants. This lecture will attempt to select several examples from these last rulers to show that we can postulate in more detail some of their fates.

        In 1932, a group of leftist poets in Shanghai established the China Poetry Society, aiming to produce poetry that would enlighten and mobilize the masses to be the self-conscious political subject. This talk revisits the poetic works and theories of the members of the Society, focusing in particular on the extensive discussion on the historical origin and political relevance of poetic rhythm and its relationship with labor. Tracking the transnational circulation and transformation of the new knowledge of bodily rhythm and poetic rhythm since the late 19th century, this talk shows how a new conception of poetic rhythm as a mediating and mobilizing device gave rise to a series of leftist poetic experiments that attempted to construct the collective political subject through invoking the bodily solidarity of the laboring masses.

        For the last seven decades, world politics has been dominated by American leadership, the institutions it has designed, and putatively liberal norms. This international order is facing severe challenges due to the rise of new powers, breakdown of old economic arrangements, and a redistribution of technological and infrastructural activity. This academic year, we are planning a series of panels that seek to examine emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older international order.

The November 2nd panel there will be a panel that discusses how global governance institutions reflect changing geopolitics and international political economy. We hope to deliberate on the impact of new powers like China, India, and other countries in the global South, and how they are leading to new distributions of power, norms, and expertise.
