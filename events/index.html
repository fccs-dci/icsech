        ALTERNATIVE HYGIENIC MODERNITY: CHINESE MEDICAL THERAPY PROJECT FOR INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION IN COLD WAR TAIWAN

        The concept of Hygienic Modernity has been proposed for about 20 years. This talk takes the Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) poisoning event in Taiwan in the Cold War period as an example to revisit this well-known concept in the modern history of East Asia. The PCBs are incurable industrial toxicants and have caused environmental pollution and food poisoning from the U.S. to East Asia since the 1970s. I argue that this pollution in Taiwan was a transformative point when industrial toxicants became modern hygienic issues, and the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine treatments for PCBs became a new kind of modernity in the 1980s. Moreover, the Kuomintang (KMT) government constructed this integrated therapeutic method to tackle the hygienic and societal disorders caused by Western industrial modernity.

In the late period of the Cold War, difficult political situations at home and abroad posed the KMT government with numerous social movements in Taiwan. During the outbreak of PCBs poisonings and the following grassroots consumerism campaigns, Li-Fu Chen, an influential KMT politician, promoted the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine for PCBs therapy beneath the official propaganda of the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Movement (1966-1991). Interdisciplinary teams conducted both animal experiments and clinical trials to validate the therapeutic effectiveness of this project. Although the long-term outcome of Chinese medicine treatment was unsatisfactory, this project benefited the KMT government’s three political goals: alleviated societal panic, propagated Taiwan’s medical achievements to the West, and institutionalized the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine.

        China’s success in cultivating Big Tech firms has enabled it to emerge as a formidable rival to the United States in the digital sphere. But in the past few years, the Chinese government has embarked on a massive regulatory crackdown, targeting its largest tech corporations such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Meituan. Many Western experts have viewed this tech crackdown as an assault on private businesses, causing doubt among investors about whether Chinese firms are still investable. Professor Angela Zhang will go beyond the headlines to unravel the dynamic complexity of China’s regulatory governance. Drawing insights from her newly published book, High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, she will introduce the dynamic pyramid model of regulation, an analytical framework that demystifies Chinese regulatory governance. She will examine the impact of the tech crackdown on the administrative state, the competitive landscape, and global tech rivalry. And she will peer into the future by examining China’s strategy for regulating generative artificial intelligence.

        Drawing on big data analytics of over 50,000 newspaper articles published in People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), this international collaborative project delves into the CCP’s narrative portrayal of the USSR from the late 1940s to the collapse of the world's first proletarian revolutionary state. The analysis reveals significant shifts in both the thematic focus of discussions surrounding socialist ideology and sentiments towards Soviet Union within Chinese official discourse over the socialist era. Notably, the distribution of discussion topics concerning the USSR appears to have been primarily influenced by China’s domestic political dynamics.

        As science and technology continue to advance, the ocean, covering 71% of the Earth’s surface, is undeniably assuming an increasingly vital role for humanity. Consequently, nations are diligently pursuing their respective maritime interests, revealing both commonalities and distinctions. The United States and China, widely recognized as major powers in contemporary international politics and prominent maritime nations, are increasingly focusing their attention on global maritime domains.

How do the maritime policies of China and the United States differ in terms of strategic objectives and priorities? What are the primary areas of competition between China and the United States in global maritime affairs? How do the maritime disputes, such as those in the South China Sea, impact the overall relations between China and the United States? Are there any ongoing cooperative efforts between China and the United States in global maritime security or environmental protection? What role do international law and institutions play in shaping the interactions between China and the United States in global maritime relations? How do the military doctrines and strategies of China and the United States intersect or diverge in the maritime domain?

In her new bookUS-China Global Maritime Relations, Dr. Nong Hong explores the U.S.-China maritime relationship within the global context and investigates six key maritime regions: the South China Sea, the Northeast Asia waters, the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, as well as the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Through detailed observations, this book offers a comprehensive exploration of these regions and their significance in shaping the dynamics between the two nations.

This event will feature the author ofUS-China Global Maritime Relations, who will discuss the evolution and execution of maritime strategies pursued by both the United States and China. Moreover, three panelists will provide their insights on this subject, representing perspectives from the United States, China, and a third-party viewpoint.

        Abstract:In the sixth chapter of the Lunyu Confucius talks about his students. It is not always easy to understand what he actually has to say about them. Moreover, sometimes he seems to contradict himself as far as other statements on the same students are concerned. Interestingly, in the 67th chapter of the Shiji, the “Zhongni dizi liezhuan” 仲尼弟子列傳, do we find many of the sayings of Lunyu 6 again, albeit sometimes in a slightly altered form. Why the text actually differs in these two sources is a question that has rarely been discussed in previous scholarship. A look at other texts which talk about the achievements of the students of Confucius may be helpful when trying to offer a solution to this problem. At the same time, it would seem important to also consider other chapters in the Lunyu in which Confucius judges on his disciples. They, too, may shed light on the hidden conflicts that apparently existed between what otherwise sometimes looks like a homogeneous group.

        China’s global engagement with countries in the developing world is rapidly evolving in an era where traditional aid discourses and the practices of emerging powers in international development are undergoing significant changes. As the largest South-South cooperation provider and the world’s second-largest economy, China’s development activities overseas have sparked debates regarding its role as a rising power in international development and its implications for the post-liberal global order. Over the past few decades, China has substantially diversified its instruments and infrastructure in development practices. While some view China as a catalyst for new models of development and growth, others accuse China of being responsible for the debt crises faced by many recipient economies. China’s involvement in international development has led to wide-ranging impacts.

This seminar series invites experts from five continents to engage in a three-part discussion on the instruments, finance, and infrastructures of China’s international development. In the first part, we explore the evolution and diversification of instruments in China’s international development practices, including its deployment of foreign aid and development finance, as well as its evolving role in international security arrangements and global economic governance institutions. In part two, we delve into the composition of Chinese development finance, comparing it to the World Bank, and examine how the Global South perceives its local impact. In part three, we take China’s global infrastructure engagement as an example to illustrate the different actors and approaches involved in China’s international development practices, as well as the role of state-led development. Using the three panel discussions, we illustrate the wide-ranging impacts of Chinese international development engagement at the local, national, and global levels.

        LOCALITY GOD VS. LOCALS: RITUAL WORSHIP AS RISK MANAGEMENT IN A SINO-MONGOLIAN MINING ENCOUNTER BY RUIYI ZHU

        This paper is concerned with the significance of rituals in transnational extractive operations, drawing on an ethnographic account of a privately-owned Chinese mining company in post-socialist Mongolia. I argue that Chinese miners adopt ritual worship of Tudi Ye (Locality God) as a strategy for managing the risks associated with extractive labor in a foreign territory. The paper further explores the contrasting perceptions of risk between the Chinese miners and the Mongolian residents and administrators, who view the mining industry as a source of danger and seek appeasement through propitiating the local land master. The parallel rituals performed by both groups shed light on the underlying political contention inherent in the mining industry. By interweaving ethnographic theories of risk with analyses of ritual politics in Chinese and Mongolian Studies, this paper provides a nuanced contextualization of transnational extractive labor and offers insight into the mobility of territorial spirits.

        On Wednesday, April 24 from 3:30 to 5pm in THO 317 and online, the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Wendy Cheng to discuss her newest book entitledIsland X:Taiwanese Student Migrants, Campus Spies, and Cold War Activism.Wendy delves into the compelling political lives of Taiwanese migrants who came to the United States as students from the 1960s through the 1980s. Often depicted as compliant model minorities, many were in fact deeply political, shaped by Taiwan’s colonial history and influenced by the global social movements of their time.

Drawing on interviews with student activists and extensive archival research, Wendy Cheng documents how Taiwanese Americans developed tight-knit social networks as infrastructures for identity formation, consciousness development, and anticolonial activism. Raising questions about historical memory and Cold War circuits of power, Island X is a testament to the lives and advocacy of a generation of Taiwanese American activists.

Wendy Chengis a Professor of American Studies at Scripps College. She received her A.B. from Harvard University in English and American Language and Literature, her M.A. in Geography from UC Berkeley, and her Ph.D. in American Studies and Ethnicity from the University of Southern California. She is the author of The Changs Next Door to the Díazes: Remapping Race in Suburban California (University of Minnesota Press, 2013), which won the 2014 Book Award from the American Sociological Association’s Section on Asia and Asian America, and coauthor of A People’s Guide to Los Angeles (University of California Press, 2012), which won the Association of American Geographers’ Globe Book Award for Public Understanding of Geography and the SCIBA Nonfiction Award.

        The Ordos Plateau, the semiarid loess-soil region of northern Shaanxi at the periphery of the East Asian summer monsoon, is a historically multiethnic domain that is sensitive to small shifts in climate. During imperial times, Ordos residents generally subsisted as herders, farmers, and salt miners. The Ordos was also a strategic zone of transit, transition and contention between the steppes and the imperial core. For that reason, it was often heavily fortified despite its unpredictable climate, its highly erodible soil, and its delicate ethnic geography. This talk presents research based on the spatial analysis of 564 data points representing the locations of cities and forts from pre-imperial times through the Qing dynasty, proxies for the intensiveness of human activity in any time and place, as recorded inTheAtlas of Chinese Material Culture(Zhongguo Wenwu dituji中国文物地图集). Each of those sites was also associated with land degradation, which in turn shaped subsequent possibilities in the region. Adopting the time scale of the entire imperial era, this research traces changes to imperial boundaries, political ecology, and state power in the context of both geopolitical and environmental histories. It also tracks the long history of conflict, coexistence, and settler colonialism in an originally multiethnic region. The paper narrates the southerly retreat of the state after the Han era as the region became more arid; the emergence of what eventually became the great wall line starting in the Tang; the militarization of that line in the Song followed by the formation of ethnically Han space along it during the in Ming; and the emergence of an even more southerly commercial and ethnically Chinese space in the Qing.

        On Thursday, May 23 from 3:30 to 5pm in THO 317 and online,the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Henry Yeung (National University of Singapore) to discuss his book Interconnected Worlds: Global Electronics and Production Networks in East Asia. His book offers key empirical observations on the highly contested and politicized nature of semiconductor global production networks since the US-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic. In this capital-intensive manufacturing industry, governance and power dynamics are manifested differently from many other industries due to highly complex technology regimes, production network ecosystems, and, more recently, geopolitical imperatives. While some of these critical dynamics had been in play ahead of the 2020s in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, their intensity and significance became more apparent by the early 2020s. The book also examines the need for strategic partnerships with technology leaders toward building national and regional resilience in the US, Western Europe, and East Asia.

ProfessorHenry Yeunghas been a Distinguished Professor at the Department of Geography, National University of Singapore, since 2018, and Professor of Economic Geography since 2005. As a leading academic expert in global production networks and the global economy, his research interests cover broadly theories and the geography of transnational corporations, East Asian firms, and developmental states. He is the first geographer based in Asia to receive both the 2018 American Association of Geographers Distinguished Scholarship Honors (“in recognition of his extraordinary scholarship and leadership in the discipline”) and the UK’s Royal Geographical Society Murchison Award 2017 (for “pioneering publications in the field of globalisation”). In November 2022, he was conferred the 2022 Sir Peter Hall Award for Lifetime Contribution to the Field by the Regional Studies Association in London: “acknowledging and celebrating excellence in the field of regional studies”.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
