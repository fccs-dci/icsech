Theatre as Business: A study of the Triangular Relations among Shanxi Merchants’ business, Theatre Sponsorship and Social Status in Late Imperial China.

Shanxi merchants were one of the most powerful merchant groups that rose in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). In the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the late Qing in particular, Shanxi merchants’ business reached its peak. They dominated the market in northern China and established the first banking industry in the country. Apart from their enormous fortune, Shanxi merchants were also famous for their passion for xiqu and for their generous support to Shanxi regional theatre, especially clapper opera or bangzi 梆子. Shanxi merchants established stages in their guildhalls and mansions, invited Shanxi local troupes to perform at bustling market towns during their meetings and social gatherings, and entertained social elites with theatrical performances from time to time.

China was historically an agricultural society where literati ranked at the top of the traditional Chinese social hierarchy, while merchants were placed at the bottom, according to Confucian and Legalist ethos. This presentation reveals that the underlying reason for Shanxi merchants’ theatre sponsorship was their pursuit of wealth, influence, fame and higher social status. Theatre sponsorship helped Shanxi merchants achieve business success, maintain a close relationship with the ruling class, and obtain and manifest their newly acquired higher status.

This presentation also shows a divergence of opinions on the primary intention of merchants’ consumption of cultural products and engagement in cultural activities, which was social emulation by nature. The once-popular idea ‘merchants as déclassé and scholars as exalted’ came to be held by the literati alone and was a futile defence that merchants did not care much about at the dusk of the imperial era.

        Over the past decade, China has been establishing access to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through infrastructure projects and trade development. The MENA is considered a crucial area in China’s foreign policy. This rapidly growing relationship has had significant geopolitical implications, particularly in the context of the rivalry between major powers such as the United States, China, the European Union, and Russia. We argue that China’s approach to establishing influence in the MENA region differs from the West’s: thus far, it has focused on economic incentives anddevelopmental projects rather than military and political tools. Shifting away from the traditional focus on great power and middle power, we propose to combine role theory with the concept of social power, to analyze China-MENA engagement in the 2020s.

        英美政治思想史的主流研究通常认为是以《大宪章》为源头，以“光荣革命”为中游，并在启蒙运动推波助澜下，才最终汇成势不可挡的宪政洪流。如果洛克的《政府论》完成了君主立宪的政治正当性论述，那么苏格兰启蒙运动就可谓为英国经济、社会的现代性变革做出了道德辩护。但当以苏格兰启蒙运动为历史分水岭，就会发现从约翰王被迫签署《大宪章》到《权利法案》的四百多年间，英国王权与宪政在金雀花王朝、都铎王朝、斯图亚特王朝都展开过刀光剑影的斗争，而这大多又在莎士比亚的系列历史剧中保存了栩栩如生的记录。本次讲座将随新书《莎士比亚历史剧与英国王权》回到历史现场，探寻不列颠人几经废立、终成正果的宪政之路。

        On January 22, 2023, less than 24 hours after the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Los Angeles County, major news sources reported conflicting information about the 72-year old shooter, Huu Can Tran: that he was “an immigrant from China” (CNN) yet “born in Vietnam” (NY Times). Two months later, Ke Huy Quan, who graduated from a high school in the neighboring city of Alhambra, won an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Asian and Asian American netizens and news outlets began to claim and debate whether Quan was Chinese or Vietnamese, with one outlet opting for “Vietnamese-born”.

This talk looks at how Vietnamese, Taiwanese and U.S. policies affected ethnic Chinese first in, and later, from southern Vietnam (“Hoa”) and Hoa reactions to these policies. I first look at the Republic of Vietnam’s “Vietnamization” policies (1955-1975) which attempted to “assimilate” (đồng-hóa/同化) the Hoa as fully-fledged Vietnamese nationals of a new postcolonial nation-state. I then reconstruct Taiwan’s role in the IndoChinese refugee crisis. As a non-UN member state by the peak of the crisis in the late 1970s, Taiwan’s contributions to the IndoChinese refugee crisis are not recorded in UNHCR statistics, which detail the global nature of resettlement (across the “Global North”). Many Hoa resettled in the United States, where their experiences in Vietnam were reconfigured in a new racial/ethnic landscape. By observing one ethnic community over half a century, my talk seeks to transpacificize across Critical Refugee, Southeast Asian, East Asian, Asian American/diasporic, and Cold War studies.

Abstract: Richard Wilhelm was a German sinologist, theologian and missionary. He is best remembered for his translations of Chinese philosophical texts from Chinese into German. His version of theYijing(I Ging, 1924) has been translated into many other languages including English, and so became widely influential.

- In his version of the Confucian Analects /Lunyu(1910), he originally produced it in two translated versions — a &quot;literal version&quot; and a &quot;modern version&quot;. Most subsequent editions eliminated the &quot;modern version&quot;. Why? He also at least in one place translated the termli禮 as &quot;Religion&quot;. Why?
- Wilhelm's version of theDaodejingrenders the termswu無 andyou有 asNichtsein(Non-being) andSein(Being). How should we consider this rendering today in the light of sinological interpretations of these terms within this context?
- Why is Wilhelm's version of theZhuangzimissing the last seven chapters?
- Wilhelm's rendering ofshengren聖人in the Yijing was regularlyDie Heilige(the saints), yet in Carl Bayne's English rendering of Wilhelm's work, he always rendered the term as &quot;sage&quot;. Why is this an important misrepresentation of Wilhelm's presentation of that difficult classical text?

        When you think about social justice, what comes to your mind? In many societies, including the United States, there has never been a more critical time for reaching some consensus of the meaning of the concepts governing our lives. We need to have a sense of what they mean to us as we make important decisions, both personal and political in our lives. This webinar is based on the latest book, Education for Social Justice: The Meaning of Justice and Current Research, published by Routledge in 2024. By clicking the link above, you will have free full access to the book. The authors of this book would like to invite you to read the sections you find of interest before attending the webinar—each chapter considers an element of social justice including, for example, civic education, informal learning and role of parents, discrimination and repression, college going and the effect of race and other factors, responsive teaching and access to knowledge, supporting mental health in community schools. Each chapter also includes a discussion of the latest research on the issue written by a now graduated doctoral student whose dissertation examined the current research. This webinar will focus on the chapter discussing the meaning of social justice from the perspective of parenting in China. One critical point about the book is to examine the “essentially contested concepts”, such as social justice and democracy, since the concepts mean different things to different people, and the different meanings influence one’s society. Please click this link and share your thoughts and questions about these concepts before the webinar so you may enjoy a relevant and dynamic discussion during the webinar. The goal of the discussion is to open your mind about these contested concepts and show how educators can help a group of students or colleagues or the public reach a “shared vision” of the meanings.

In The Oldtimers, his third collection of poetry, Wing Tek Lum imagines life in Honolulu Chinatown circa 1900, giving voice to the forgotten pioneer generation of sojourners and settlers, detailing the trials and temptations of this bachelor society living far from their homeland - their hard work, their diversions, their challenges, and, even amidst the notorious plague and fire, their perseverance. For the EALL Talk Series, Wing Tek will share certain poems inspired by his research into the unique history and customs of this immigrant community at the turn of the last century.

This event is co-sponsored by the Center for Chinese Studies. We thank the Center and the C.Q. Yee Grant for supporting the Center’s speaker series on “Chinese Heritage in Hawaii: Connections, Contestations, and Collaborations,” of which Wing Tek Lum is the first speaker.

Wing Tek Lum is a Honolulu businessman and poet. Bamboo Ridge Press has published three collections of his poetry: Expounding the Doubtful Points (1987), The Nanjing Massacre: Poems (2012), and The Oldtimers (newly released).

The talk is open to the public.

        In the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai became a dynamic metropolis, blending Western influences with traditional Chinese culture and creating a unique urban atmosphere. This fusion of ideas and aesthetics shaped every aspect of city life, especially cinema, which was pivotal in expressing and influencing this cultural combination.

Gu Si-Yang examines films from this era that captured the tensions between tradition and progress, offering a window into a society’s hopes, struggles, and aspirations on the verge of transformation. This speech delves deeper into these cinematic and cultural developments, exploring their lasting impact on Shanghai and the broader trajectory of Chinese modernity.

        State-building in conflict-prone societies faces the challenge of autonomous armed groups. We argue that military centralization, while strengthening a state’s ability to control the upper elites of these armed groups, can weaken the state's coercive capacity by reducing discipline and efficiency among the lower ranks in these groups. This talk studies a centralization reform in China’s Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), and finds that centralization reduced rebellions by local generals but led to more mutinies in the lower ranks of the military, more civilian uprisings, and worse battlefield performance. These findings highlight the complex effects of military centralization on the state’s coercive capacity, often overlooked in political science. (Co-author: Joy Chen)

        &quot;Good Wife, Wise Mother”: Assimilating Han Taiwanese Under Japanese Rule

In 1897, two years after Japan began its half-century rise as an imperial power, it inaugurated an ambitious experiment to make modern Japanese citizens out of Han Taiwanese schoolgirls in its first overseas colony, Taiwan. The goal of the segregated education was to train Taiwanese boys and men to become government clerks and teachers, and girls and women to become “good wives, wise mothers” (ryōsai kenbo). This gendered education was part of dōka, the Japanese assimilation program, as it sought to make everyone in the empire “Japanese” as equals by teaching the Japanese language and imperial ethics with gendered roles. Constructed by engaging with the cult of domesticity in the West that envisioned the home as a private space for women and the workplace as a public space for men to build strong nation-states, “good wife, wise mother” emerged in Japan in the 1890s and was introduced to Taiwan in the same decade.

Using periodicals and Japanese language textbooks, I examine the discourse and implementation of this ideal womanhood in Taiwan. This ideal of womanhood was crucial to the civilizing mission of the colonizers. Japanese colonial authority used gender to increase the supposed distance of civilizational levels between the colonizer and the colonized. By introducing gender into the discussion on dōka in Taiwan, I show that the promise of equality and inclusion from dōka became even less attainable and thus slowed assimilation to the supposedly superior Japanese civilization when colonial officials and educators characterized the colonized as feminine and depicted colonized women as the symbol of Taiwan’s “backwardness.”

Gendered assimilation became almost attainable for the Taiwanese toward the end of World War II compared to the pre-war dōka efforts. Ethnic and class divisions were blurred during wartime mobilization as the colonial government expanded the responsibilities of schoolgirls and women, thus blurring the distinction between Taiwanese and Japanese. Wartime mobilization redefined gendered assimilation in colonial Taiwan, as it shifted the training and focus of “good wives, wise mothers”, from the individual households only, to the entire empire, which meant that schoolgirls were trained to become “good wives, wise mothers” of the empire.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

        This study is based on a database encompassing all instances of political succession in imperial China, constructed by the speaker from a large collection of historical sources. The analysis reveals that only half of the designated successors in the two millennia of imperial Chinese history successfully ascended to power. These divergent outcomes are best explained by the age of the ruling monarch, the age gap between the ruling monarch and the designated successor, and the presence or absence of powerful officials at court. These findings the conventional wisdom that uses primogeniture to explain political succession and instead emphasizes the influence of non-institutional factors.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
