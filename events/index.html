        自1920年代中国共产党成立、第一次国共合作及破裂，中美关系就被国共斗争和列强在华争斗所制约。日本侵华导致了第二次国共合作和中美的战略合作。日本投降和冷战爆发又使中美关系陷入新的结构性困局。1949年毛泽东“告别”司徒雷登，决定新中国的外交“一边倒”，次年的朝鲜战争更使中美关系冰冻20余年。从1950年代后期莫斯科和北京的关系持续交恶，到1960年代末，中国国内文革造成混乱和在外部腹背受敌，陷入险境；美国则因深陷越南战争导致其世界地位下跌。双方开始共同探索如何打开和解之门，后经近十年磨合，中美终于在1979年建立正式外交关系。改革开放和中美建交是中国“腾飞”的两个发动机，而崛起的中国逐渐让美国变得忧心忡忡，先后启动“亚洲再平衡”、贸易战和今天全方位的双边与全球竞争。本讲座由牛军和贾庆国两位教授与大家分享中美关系激荡的百年史。本期讲座与《中美印象》网联合举办。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道收看讲座。

        NEGOTIATING CHINESE CHRISTIANITY: SOUTH CHINA ANGLICANS, 1849-1951

        What did it mean to be a Chinese Christian in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? An illiterate old woman in Kowloon toiling to recite the Lord’s Prayer? Graduates from Hong Kong mission schools using Christianity as a vehicle for modernization and ‘saving the nation’? Chinese bishops renouncing foreign missions as a form of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism?

This paper explores the volatile dynamics of Chinese Christianity in nineteenth- and twentieth-century China. Using South China Anglicans as a case-study, it highlights how Chinese Christians had to negotiate their identity and purpose constantly across five regimes between 1849 and 1951. They were under foreign missionary guidance in the late Qing period. Christian modernity and patriotic Protestantism seemed like the way forwards in the republican years. However, the May Fourth Movement and antiforeign nationalism new tension between Chinese Christians and foreign missions. They then had to navigate through the trauma of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Finally, the Communist Revolution reset relations with foreign missions and the Chinese state.

Recent work has shed light on the contexts and formations of Chinese Christianity, especially how individual churches gradually moved towards their respective destinations. This study emphasizes how rupture and redefinition were normative, and how for South China Anglicans there was in fact no clear destination. This study invites further reflection on the search for Chinese Christianity and modern China in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

        Dr Bingchun Meng has written extensively about Chinese social media and its subjects. She provides a profound analysis of topics such as knowledge production, gender research and power structure, social science studies standpoints and academic awareness in different social contexts in China and the West. Her recent publication, The Politics of Chinese Media: Consensus and Contestation (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), offers an analytical account of the consensus and contestations of the politics of Chinese media at both institutional and discursive levels. It considers the formal politics of how the Chinese state manages political communication internally and externally in the post-socialist era, and examines the politics of news media, focusing particularly on how journalists navigate the competing demands of the state, the capital and the urban middle class readership. The book also addresses the politics of entertainment media, in terms of how power operates upon and within media culture, and the politics of digital networks, highlighting how the Internet has become the battlefield of ideological contestation while also shaping how political negotiations are conducted. Bearing in mind the contemporary relevance of China’s socialist revolution, this text challenges both the liberal universalist view that presupposes ‘the end of history’ and various versions of China exceptionalism, which downplay the impact of China’s integration into global capitalism.

        The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the public finances of African countries. It also led to rising debt levels in many African countries and has increased concerns about their ability to make their scheduled sovereign debt payments over the next few years. This looming debt crisis raises questions about how these countries can most effectively manage their debts and how their creditors can help them develop in sustainable and inclusive ways. Daniel Bradlow, SARCHI Professor of International Development Law and African Economic Relations at the University of Pretoria, and Magalie Masamba, Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria, will present key findings from the 2021 book, “COVID-19 and Sovereign Debt: The Case of SADC”, a multi-disciplinary publication focusing on the issue of African sovereign debt management and renegotiation/restructuring in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

Join us on Tuesday, December 13, for a discussion on COVID-19, sovereign debt and the case of the SADC region. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        Macau's 123 Incident in 1966 – 67 is best known as a side-show to the Cultural Revolution, a piece of local history whose main significance is as a precursor to the far more violent Hong Kong &quot;disturbances&quot; six months later. In this paper, I argue that a bigger story is needed. Based on decades of oral history and archival research in collaboration with Dr. Agnes Lam of the University of Macau, this project argues that the 123 Incident cannot be understood without reference to Macau’s position at the intersection of multiple contradictory but overlapping global projects in the post-war world. Adopting a multi-scalar framework, I examine how particular combinations of institutions and individuals, interests and ideologies, understandings and misunderstandings — local, regional, national and transnational — came together in the 123 Incident to produce an effect that was at once intensely local and profoundly global. Such an approach can provide new perspectives not just on the 123 Incident, but also on the Cultural Revolution as a global event.

        Capital punishment has occupied a unique position in Chinese legal history. As a permanent fixture in imperial China’s legal system, capital punishment was the sole corporal punishment consistently employed by various dynasties from Pre-Qin to the late Qing. From legislation to judicial practices, the use of ultimate punishment in Chinese history has been riddled with contradictions and complexities. This research addresses these dilemmas by placing an analytical spotlight on the functionality, rather than merely the mechanisms of state-endorsed killing. It chronicles the origins and evolution of capital punishment in pre-modern China by examining continuity and changes, execution methods and rituals, and how capital punishment was understood and experienced in history.

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnus is an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.
