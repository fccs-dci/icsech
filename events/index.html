        In 1971, UN Resolution 2758 granted the seat occupied by the Republic of China in the General Assembly and the Security Council to the People's Republic of China (PRC). In recent years, the PRC has attempted to reinterpret this resolution as an endorsement of its &quot;One China Principle,&quot; and it has promoted the fallacy that UN member states came to a determination that Taiwan was a part of the PRC. Yet, as the historical official records show, member states made no such determination about Taiwan's international status.

This effort around Resolution 2758 is part of a broader campaign by the PRC to expand its influence in UN-affiliated bodies. Taiwan remains the foremost target of this campaign. Since 2016, at Beijing's behest, Taiwanese representatives have been blocked from participating even as observers in international organizations such as the World Health Assembly (WHA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The PRC has institutionalized and normalized its stance on Taiwan within these organizations by signing secret agreements, restricting the access of Taiwan nationals to the UN and its facilities, and embedding PRC nationals across various levels of UN staff. The UN and its specialized agencies have not made the texts of these agreements available to the public or to any entity beyond the main signatories, though leaked guidance memos provide insights into the scope of MOU contents.

In this event, Jessica Drun will discuss Beijing’s efforts to “internationalize” its “One China Principle&quot; and to conflate it with UN Resolution 2758. Her remarks will draw on a recent report, co-authored with Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund, that documents Beijing’s expanding influence in UN-linked organizations. She will be joined by Chih-Fu Yeh, a Ph.D. candidate in biology at Stanford University, who in December 2020 was improperly barred from joining a UNESCO-backed winter school session because of his Taiwanese nationality. Mr. Yeh will describe his own experience and highlight how overly strict interpretations of UN regulations and guidelines continue to impose real costs on Taiwanese citizens.

        What constitutes being human? What are the boundaries or fuzzy edges of humanity? What can we learn from exploring the margins of humanity? These questions lie at the heart of this symposium, which will bring together twelve scholars across a variety of fields to consider how concepts analogous to our contemporary idea of “the human” were defined and debated in Medieval China.

We hope that the papers assembled for the symposium will open new, interdisciplinary vistas on the ways in which ethnocultural others, sociological underclasses, striking and different individuals, animals and gods, and ex- and future-humans were conceptualized and written about in the medieval period, and on the ways in which these marginal beings expressed and challenged the self-understandings of the authors of the materials that survive to us.

The symposium will be held via Zoom from 10am to 1pm, EST, on June 1st through June 3rd, 2022. Registration is free andopen to the public.

        This book talk for Indelible City; Dispossession and Defiance in Hong Kong (Riverhead Books, Text Publishing 2022) explores a new attempt to craft a history for Hong Kong centring local voices. It describes how the book uses archival research and recently released oral history accounts from the 1980s and 1990s to restore the voices of the Unofficials (the Unofficial Members of Exco and Legco), and thus revisits the 1982-1984 negotiation of the Joint Declaration from a Hong Kong perspective. The talk also explores the media creation of the King of Kowloon as an icon symbolising Hong Kong identity. It will introduce research investigating the mechanics of icon creation by showing how both Anglophone and Sinophone Hong Kong newspapers represented the King of Kowloon across three separate decades. It will also investigate the differing depictions in Anglophone and Sinophone public spheres, as well as using autoethnographic self-reflective practice to interrogate the narrator’s roles as a Hong Kong author, researcher and journalist.

Louisa Lim is the author of Indelible City; Dispossession and Defiance in Hong Kong, published by Riverhead books. Her first book The People’s Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited (Oxford University Press, 2014), was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize and the Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism.

        Is China a “rogue donor” that uses its largesse to prop up corrupt and authoritarian regimes? Does Beijing bankroll politically motivated and economically inefficient ‘‘white elephants”? What are the risks of borrowing from Beijing? The existing debate about China’s overseas lending and grant-giving activities is largely guided by opinion and conjecture rather than rigorous evidence. In this talk, Dr. Parks will set the record straight with a new dataset of international development finance from China that captures 13,427 projects worth $843 billion across 165 countries over an 18-year period.

        China today seems caught in a contradiction: a capitalist state led by a Communist party. But as Jason Kelly shows inMarket Maoists, this seeming paradox is nothing new. Since the 1930s, before the Chinese Communist Party came to power, Communist traders and diplomats have sought deals with capitalists in an effort to fuel political transformation and the restoration of Chinese power. For as long as there have been Communists in China, they have been reconciling revolutionary aspirations at home with market realities abroad.

Jason Kelly unearths this hidden history of global commerce, finding that even Mao Zedong saw no fundamental conflict between trading with capitalists and chasing revolution. China’s ties to capitalism transformed under Mao but were never broken. And it was not just goods and currencies that changed hands. Sustained contact with foreign capitalists shaped the Chinese nation under Communism and left deep impressions on foreign policy. Deals demanded mutual intelligibility and cooperation. As a result, international transactions facilitated the exchange of ideas, habits, and beliefs, leaving subtle but lasting effects on the values and attitudes of individuals and institutions.

Drawing from official and commercial archives around the world, including newly available internal Chinese Communist Party documents,Market Maoistsrecasts our understanding of China’s relationship with global capitalism, revealing how these early accommodations laid the groundwork for China’s embrace of capitalism in the 1980s and after.

        This is a hybrid event.

How closely aligned are China and Russia? Why won’t China condemn Putin’s Ukraine war? How to define and measure strategic alignments between states? This book talk for China-Russia Strategic Alignment in International Politics (Amsterdam University Press, 2022) bridges area studies and International Relations theory to answer these questions. Post-Cold War China-Russia strategic cooperation has developed significantly and become an increasingly important factor in international politics. However, there has been no theory-grounded framework and corresponding measurements that would allow an accurate and systematic assessment of the level of China-Russia alignment and its progress over time. This book develops a set of objective criteria to measure and explain the development of strategic alignment in post-Cold War China-Russia relations. The book establishes that on a range of criteria, China-Russia alignment has been moving towards a full-fledged alliance, showing a consistent incremental upward trend. There are strong structural incentives for furthering the China-Russia alignment and the war in Ukraine is unlikely to change that trend. The alignment framework developed in the book can be applied to other cases of interstate strategic cooperation to facilitate cross-country comparisons.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
