        CHINA’S NEXT ACT: HOW SUSTAINABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY ARE RESHAPING CHINA
      </h3></div><div><p class="text-gray-800 text-sm">

        If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that the world is bound together by shared challenges—and that at the center of those challenges stands China. Thanks to decades of breakneck growth and development, Chinese officials, businesses, and institutions now play a critical role in every major global issue, from climate change to biotechnology. China’s Next Act re-envisions China’s role in the world in terms of sustainability and technology. This reframing is essential both because none of these increasingly pressing, shared global challenges can be tackled without China, and because they are reshaping China’s economy and its foreign policy, with major implications for the world at large. At the same time, sustainability and technology issues present opportunities for intensified economic, geopolitical, and ideological competition—a reality that Beijing recognizes.

The danger is that China’s next act will drive divergence on the rules and standards the world desperately needs to tackle shared challenges in the decades ahead. In some areas, like clean technology development, competition can be good for the planet. But in others, it could be catastrophic: only cooperation can lower the risks of artificial intelligence and other disruptive new technologies.

The challenges posed by climate change, pandemics, and emerging technologies make dealing with China’s state, its firms, and other institutions more complex and more critical than ever before. China’s Next Act helps foreign countries, companies, and other organizations prepare for a future shaped by sustainability, technology—and a dramatic new chapter for China and the world.

 &quot;Xi's new Team&quot;

By now, it's common knowledge that the Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of political power in China, is stocked with Xi Jinping loyalists. But beyond their personal connections to Xi, what do we know about the six men joining him on the PSC? On paper, their credentials may look typical: two sitting PSC members, the party secretaries of Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangdong, and Xi's de facto chief of staff. But several of the new members- most notably, Li Qiang, the presumed next premier, and Cai Qi-skipped steps in the typical career trajectory. The new emphasis on loyalty over experience sets the tone for Xi's &quot;New Era': Xi wants men who will enforce his decision, not technocrats to make policy decisions of their own. The case of Li Qiang's handling of shanghai's COVID-19 outbreak is an instructive example of what we can expect from the new PSC.

 &quot;The Path Not Taken&quot;

Thetalk will focus on the direction China has taken since Xi Jinping and the leadership decided to turn away from the 60-point market reform package of 2013, and instead, adopted the &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; development strategy. The result has been a much more statist domestic economic agenda and a much more mercantilist foreign policy agenda. The 20th Party Congress, with its rejection of any reformist wing, is doubling down on nationalism, Marxism-Leninism, and the Xi thought, and the consolidation of central power simply reinforces trends begun almost a decade before.

 &quot;Xi Jinping Thought for the new Journey&quot;

The articulation of Xi Jinping Thought at CPC's twentieth congress acquired a new sophistication and claimed more authenticity. The function of this new stress on ideology has to be understood keeping in view the stated and unstated goals of: legitimation, centralized governance, crisis management, and the great power aspirations.

        Part of the University of Chicago Center for East Asian Studies' East Asia by the Book! CEAS Author Talks series, this event will take place virtually on Zoom. Hear the author, Professor Haun Saussy, talk about his recent publication. Debates on the canon, multiculturalism, and world literature often take Eurocentrism as the target of their critique. But literature is a universe with many centers, and one of them is China. The Making of Barbarians offers an account of world literature in which China, as center, produces its own margins. This book investigates the meanings of literary translation, adaptation, and appropriation on the boundaries of China long before it came into sustained contact with the West. Professor Saussy focuses on the period before 1850, when the translation of foreign works into Chinese was rare because Chinese literary tradition overshadowed those around it. This publication looks closely at literary works that were translated into Chinese from foreign languages or resulted from contact with alien peoples. It explores why translation was such an undervalued practice in premodern China, and how this vast and prestigious culture dealt with those outside it before a new group of foreigners—Europeans—appeared on the horizon.

        In many advanced countries, traditional forms of capitalism have increasingly come under criticism as contributing to economic and social inequality and failing to serve the needs of society. To address these shortcomings, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is proposing a “new form of capitalism” for the country. In the US, business leaders talk about promoting “stakeholder capitalism” over “shareholder capitalism.” Law Professors Gen Goto and Curtis J. Milhaupt will discuss the similarities and differences between these two sets of ideas and the implications for corporate governance and society.

        The U.S.-China relationship is the most important in the world, with decisions affecting the world’s chances for global peace, prosperity, and sustainability. Each country has its own view of what its role, and the other’s role, in the world should be in the 21stCentury. These views are not entirely in sync. This has created tensions, and could become more destabilizing. However, it’s in the interests of both countries to find a way forward together that leaves room for cooperation, competition, perhaps even confrontation, without leading to war — Coexistence 2.0, a more complex and engaged form of coexistence than the United States had with the Soviet Union in the last century.

Major questions framing what is possible include what China wants, how China’s domestic realities affect President Xi Jinping’s dream of “rejuvenating” China and, the actions he can take at home and abroad, how much and in what ways the United States and its allies can influence Beijing’s decision-making, and what greater global forces and trends are at play, affecting what the United States, China, or the two of them together, can do or might want to do.

This symposium aims to provoke thought on these questions, and to deepen understanding of the U.S.-China relationship. The conference is co-presented by the Harvard University Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies and the Harvard Kennedy Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia, with support from the Asia Society’s Center on U.S.-China Relations and UC San Diego’s 21stCentury China Center.

        About the Books
(Foreign Banks and Global Finance in Modern China: Banking on the Chinese Frontier, 1870-1919)
In this wide-ranging study, Ghassan Moazzin sheds critical new light on the history of foreign banks in late nineteenth and early twentieth century China, a time that saw a substantial influx of foreign financial institutions into China and a rapid increase of both China’s foreign trade and its interactions with international capital markets. Drawing on a broad range of German, English, Japanese and Chinese primary sources, including business records, government documents and personal papers, Moazzin reconstructs how during this period foreign banks facilitated China’s financial integration into the first global economy and provided the financial infrastructure required for modern economic globalization in China. Foreign Banks and Global Finance in Modern China shows the key role international finance and foreign banks and capital markets played at important turning points in modern Chinese history.

(Hong Kong Takes Flight: Commercial Aviation and the Making of a Global Hub, 1930s–1998)
Commercial aviation took shape in Hong Kong as the city developed into a powerful economy. Rather than accepting air travel as an inevitability in the era of global mobility, John Wong argues that Hong Kong’s development into a regional and global airline hub was not preordained. By underscoring the shifting process through which this hub emerged, _Hong Kong Takes Flight_ aims to describe globalization and global networks in the making. Viewing the globalization of the city through the prism of its airline industry, Wong examines how policymakers and businesses asserted themselves against international partners and competitors in a bid to accrue socioeconomic benefits, negotiated their interests in Hong Kong’s economic success, and articulated their expressions of modernity.

        Today American institutions dominate nearly every major ranking of global universities. Yet in historical terms, America’s preeminence is relatively new, and there is no reason to assume that U.S. schools will continue to lead the world a century from now. Indeed, America’s supremacy in higher education is under great stress, particularly at its public universities. At the same time Chinese universities are on the ascent. Thirty years ago, Chinese institutions were reopening after the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution; today they are some of the most innovative educational centers in the world. Will China threaten American primacy?

Empires of Ideas looks to the past two hundred years for answers, chronicling two revolutions in higher education: the birth of the research university and its integration with the liberal education model. William C. Kirbyexamines the successes of leading universities—The University of Berlin and the Free University of Berlin in Germany; Harvard, Duke, and the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States—to determine how they rose to prominence and what threats they currently face. Kirby draws illuminating comparisons to the trajectories of three Chinese contenders: Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, and the University of Hong Kong, which aim to be world-class institutions that can compete with the best the United States and Europe have to offer. But Chinese institutions also face obstacles. Kirby analyzes the challenges that Chinese academic leaders must confront: reinvesting in undergraduate teaching, developing new models of funding, and navigating a political system that may undermine a true commitment to free inquiry and academic excellence.

In this MCI webinar, Prof. Kirby will delve deeper into the key points of his acclaimed book and participate in a Q&amp;amp;A session subsequent to the talk.

        In May 1983, two Chinese engineers spent ten days visiting the decrepit Bolton Falls Dam on the Winooski River in upper Vermont. The visit likely raised eyebrows on both sides of the Pacific. Unlike most of their countrymen, who were sent abroad on study tours by their home institutions in China, these engineers were in Vermont at the invitation of the dam’s American owners, the Green Mountain Power Corporation. Having failed to obtain an affordable renovation plan from domestic consultants, Green Mountain had only done the logical thing and turned to the global leaders in small hydropower: China. In this talk, which draws upon ongoing research for a book on the history of small hydropower in China, Dr. Ghosh will first briefly trace China’s rise to a position of global leadership in small hydropower. Ghosh then will explore the activities of the Chinese-American engineer Alexander A.S. Tseng and the company he founded, Oriental Engineering &amp;amp; Supply Company (ORENCO). In 1972, Tseng was a member of the first delegation of Chinese-American scientists to visit the PRC. Recognizing China’s expertise and experience in small hydropower, Tseng set up ORENCO and brought that expertise to the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, helping build or restore nearly forty small dams across the country.

        Sometime during the 10th to 13th centuries CE a system of long-walls (or 'Great Walls') was built in areas currently in North China and Northeastern Mongolia. This network of walls, forts, and enclosures covers an estimated area of 4000 km and spans a wide range of ecozones, from the deserts of western China to the steppes of northern Mongolia and the Khingan mountain range. While this is one of the longest and most elaborate systems of its kind the world has ever seen, it is unclear who built it, when exactly it was built and for what purpose. Prof. Shelach-Lavi is heading a new research project, titledThe Wall(https://thewall.huji.ac.il/), which combines archaeological, geographic, historic and paleo-climatic data to date, map and analyze this extensive wall-system. In this talk he will report on the work done so farand on new insights that it generated.

        Taiwan is featuring with ever greater frequency in Australian discussions surrounding the diplomacy, politics, security, business, and culture of the East Asian region. It is, therefore, an opportune time to launch an annual ANU Taiwan Update under the auspices of the ANU Taiwan Studies Program. Drawing on the best of scholarship on Taiwan from Australia and internationally, including from Taiwan itself, the Update will present informed and authoritative information and analysis on where Taiwan is situated in 2022, including in relation to its great neighbour across the Strait.

This year’s update begins on the evening of Monday 28 November with an in-person and online panel discussion on the current state of cross-strait relations, focussing on strategic concerns, on cyber-security and disinformation, and on business. On Tuesday 29 November, four keynote addresses will be presented by experts from Taiwan and the UK on Taiwanese environmental literature, major social changes since 2000, internal politics and the local elections — which will be held just before the Update — and on the Taiwanese semi-conductor industry. Together these presentations will grant participants in the Update a uniquely well-informed view of where Taiwan stands today and what lies ahead.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        UNLEASHING MASS ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE IMPACT OF CHINA’S REGISTERED CAPITAL REFORM

        About the event

Stimulating private entrepreneurship has been a purportedly vital item on the Chinese government’s recent policy agenda, though perhaps few have given it credence. Arguably the most significant legislative implementation of this policy was the 2013 amendment of the Company Law, which reformed long-standing “registered capital” rules. Professor Wei Cui will discuss a research project (conducted with Mengying Wei) that uses confidential taxpayer data to identify the reform’s impact on firm formation, firm financing choices, and overall firm performance. Preliminary findings include that the reform enabled new firms to start with 40% lower assets but generate similar levels of revenues and profits as firms registered before the reform, indicating an improvement in investment efficiency. New firms optimized their financing structure by borrowing more and smoothing equity contributions over time. The reform also substantially increased firm registration, and there is suggestive evidence that it allowed productive but wealth-constrained firms to enter.

About the speaker



Wei Cui is a visiting professor of law at NYU School of Law. He has taught at the Peter A. Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia since 2013. His research and writing span a wide range of topics in tax law and policy, including international taxation, tax administration and compliance, tax and development, the value added tax, and tax and spending policies targeted at the labor market. His most recent book, The Administrative Foundations of the Chinese Fiscal State (Cambridge University Press 2022), offers a systematic study of Chinese taxation that explains the lessons China’s successful revenue-raising effort holds for developing countries, the reasons why mainstream economic theories must be revised to recognize fundamentally different types of state capacity, and the challenging questions the Chinese paradigm raises for the future of taxation.

About the discussant

Robert J. Jackson, Jr. is the Pierrepont Family Professor of Law, co-director of the Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance, and director of the Program on Corporate Law and Policy at the New York University School of Law. His research identifying significant insider trading before the announcement of significant corporate developments led to legislation to outlaw that trading. His calls for an insider-trading law for the 21st century produced a bipartisan bill to close gaps in existing law. He served as a commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission from 2017-2020, where he advocated for more transparency in capital markets and evidence-driven policymaking. Before that, Professor Jackson taught at Columbia Law School. He also previously was a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department during the financial crisis and a deputy to Kenneth Feinberg, Treasury’s special master on executive compensation. Earlier in his career, Professor Jackson practiced law at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp;amp; Katz and was an investment banker at Bear, Stearns.

        Silvia Lindtner is working on two intertwined topics at the moment: on the one hand, she looks at how data-driven experiments in computer science are applied to transform China's agriculture. This mostly involves research in large-scale farming experiments at the outskirts of China's big cities (precision farming, partnerships between SOEs, Chinese universities' computer science programs, and international/multinational partners). On the other hand, she looks at how these large-scale (and often state-driven) data-driven experiments sit alongside what some have described as a broader &quot;inwards&quot; turn - specifically, she has been doing research with a younger generation of transnational Chinese who decide to move to rural China instead of taking the high-tech jobs in Shanghai and San Francisco, experimenting with permaculture farming, eco-farming, and various forms of spiritual and shamanistic practice. Her initial research sites were in rural Jiangxi and Guangdong, but she is now working on establishing access to some sites here in Yunnan, since there are quite a few activities here as well. Part of her bigger argument is that both the large-scale data-driven farming experiments and the &quot;youths turning inwards&quot; phenomenon are enrolled into two of the state's major policies, &quot;rural revitalization&quot;乡村振兴 and &quot;digitization/data-driven transformation&quot; 数字化, each framed as key to China's future challenges of national sovereignty and food security.

        Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China over 70 years ago, five paramount leaders have shaped the fates and fortunes of the nation and the ruling Chinese Communist Party: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping. Drawing on his recent book,China’s Leaders: From Mao to Now, in this lecture Professor David Shambaugh will explore the differing backgrounds, contrasting leadership styles, and impact of each paramount leader.

        Dr Bingchun Meng has written extensively about Chinese social media and its subjects. She provides a profound analysis of topics such as knowledge production, gender research and power structure, social science studies standpoints and academic awareness in different social contexts in China and the West. Her recent publication, The Politics of Chinese Media: Consensus and Contestation (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), offers an analytical account of the consensus and contestations of the politics of Chinese media at both institutional and discursive levels. It considers the formal politics of how the Chinese state manages political communication internally and externally in the post-socialist era, and examines the politics of news media, focusing particularly on how journalists navigate the competing demands of the state, the capital and the urban middle class readership. The book also addresses the politics of entertainment media, in terms of how power operates upon and within media culture, and the politics of digital networks, highlighting how the Internet has become the battlefield of ideological contestation while also shaping how political negotiations are conducted. Bearing in mind the contemporary relevance of China’s socialist revolution, this text challenges both the liberal universalist view that presupposes ‘the end of history’ and various versions of China exceptionalism, which downplay the impact of China’s integration into global capitalism.

        The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the public finances of African countries. It also led to rising debt levels in many African countries and has increased concerns about their ability to make their scheduled sovereign debt payments over the next few years. This looming debt crisis raises questions about how these countries can most effectively manage their debts and how their creditors can help them develop in sustainable and inclusive ways. Daniel Bradlow, SARCHI Professor of International Development Law and African Economic Relations at the University of Pretoria, and Magalie Masamba, Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria, will present key findings from the 2021 book, “COVID-19 and Sovereign Debt: The Case of SADC”, a multi-disciplinary publication focusing on the issue of African sovereign debt management and renegotiation/restructuring in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

Join us on Tuesday, December 13, for a discussion on COVID-19, sovereign debt and the case of the SADC region. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        Capital punishment has occupied a unique position in Chinese legal history. As a permanent fixture in imperial China’s legal system, capital punishment was the sole corporal punishment consistently employed by various dynasties from Pre-Qin to the late Qing. From legislation to judicial practices, the use of ultimate punishment in Chinese history has been riddled with contradictions and complexities. This research addresses these dilemmas by placing an analytical spotlight on the functionality, rather than merely the mechanisms of state-endorsed killing. It chronicles the origins and evolution of capital punishment in pre-modern China by examining continuity and changes, execution methods and rituals, and how capital punishment was understood and experienced in history.

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnus is an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.
