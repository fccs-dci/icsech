        The National Security Law, which China imposed on Hong Kong in 2020, takes precedence over local law and has profoundly affected civil liberties and the right to fair trial. Does this mean international law no longer matters in Hong Kong? Our speaker, Carole Petersen, professor of law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, finds that in cases not affecting Beijing’s core interests, local judges still rely on international and comparative sources and still rule against the local Hong Kong government. This has been particularly evident in strategic litigation to advance the rights of the LGBT community. Petersen concludes that if the local government is serious about trying to rebuild Hong Kong’s international reputation, then it should accept and fully implement these rulings.

        State-building in conflict-prone societies faces the challenge of autonomous armed groups. We argue that military centralization, while strengthening a state’s ability to control the upper elites of these armed groups, can weaken the state's coercive capacity by reducing discipline and efficiency among the lower ranks in these groups. This talk studies a centralization reform in China’s Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), and finds that centralization reduced rebellions by local generals but led to more mutinies in the lower ranks of the military, more civilian uprisings, and worse battlefield performance. These findings highlight the complex effects of military centralization on the state’s coercive capacity, often overlooked in political science. (Co-author: Joy Chen)

In 1897, two years after Japan began its half-century rise as an imperial power, it inaugurated an ambitious experiment to make modern Japanese citizens out of Han Taiwanese schoolgirls in its first overseas colony, Taiwan. The goal of the segregated education was to train Taiwanese boys and men to become government clerks and teachers, and girls and women to become “good wives, wise mothers” (ryōsai kenbo). This gendered education was part of dōka, the Japanese assimilation program, as it sought to make everyone in the empire “Japanese” as equals by teaching the Japanese language and imperial ethics with gendered roles. Constructed by engaging with the cult of domesticity in the West that envisioned the home as a private space for women and the workplace as a public space for men to build strong nation-states, “good wife, wise mother” emerged in Japan in the 1890s and was introduced to Taiwan in the same decade.

Using periodicals and Japanese language textbooks, I examine the discourse and implementation of this ideal womanhood in Taiwan. This ideal of womanhood was crucial to the civilizing mission of the colonizers. Japanese colonial authority used gender to increase the supposed distance of civilizational levels between the colonizer and the colonized. By introducing gender into the discussion on dōka in Taiwan, I show that the promise of equality and inclusion from dōka became even less attainable and thus slowed assimilation to the supposedly superior Japanese civilization when colonial officials and educators characterized the colonized as feminine and depicted colonized women as the symbol of Taiwan’s “backwardness.”

Gendered assimilation became almost attainable for the Taiwanese toward the end of World War II compared to the pre-war dōka efforts. Ethnic and class divisions were blurred during wartime mobilization as the colonial government expanded the responsibilities of schoolgirls and women, thus blurring the distinction between Taiwanese and Japanese. Wartime mobilization redefined gendered assimilation in colonial Taiwan, as it shifted the training and focus of “good wives, wise mothers”, from the individual households only, to the entire empire, which meant that schoolgirls were trained to become “good wives, wise mothers” of the empire.

Iconic Mao—A Biography in Images

This study of Mao Zedong focuses on one hyper-visible protagonist of the twentieth century—master choreographer of his image—to ask how this flesh-and-blood man has been transformed into a globally recognizable “bio-icon”. The book argues that lookingat—rather thanthrough—images (literary, visual, musical, filmic etc.) can fundamentally alter the trajectory and indeed the terms of a historian’s work: images are constitutive rather than merely reflective of the histories that produce them. By showing how images of Mao have been read in different times and by different people in China and beyond, I am able to draw connections between his (visible) imaged body, picture power and its (invisible) emotional, experiential, sensual effects on the personal, national and global scale.

At a moment when histories of global or transcultural Mao-ism are just beginning to appear, I am taking these as my point of departure, trying to understand, how Mao (and others) invested his body and performative gestures with special symbolic meaning, how his charismatic image was manufactured and how it plays out, successfully, in his own constituency and elsewhere.

This talk will make visible some of the lasting shapes that Mao has assumed in the memory cultures of the present, and illustrate how his iconic image has affected and animated others, as reflections of how his ideas have been understood and applied. In reading his images intertextually, as visual biographies, so to speak, I am probing into how he is remembered and enshrined, or, put differently, how he lives on in people’s minds.

        One of the most complicated issues in contemporary international relations is the status of the self-governing island of Taiwan and its government in Taipei, formally called the government of the Republic of China. Is Taiwan a sovereign state? What is the legal relationship between the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China? Is United Nations membership essential for statehood? How should other states engage with Taiwan? How much of US support for Taiwan is grounded in law and how much in policy? Does international law recognize Taiwan’s right of self-defense or the right of its friends to come to its aid?

Over the coming months, the U.S.-Asia Law Institute will host a series of speakers to address these questions from different perspectives. The first speaker will be Richard Bush, nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Bush led US engagement with Taiwan from 1997 to 2002 as chairman and managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the mechanism through which the US government conducts substantive relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations. Bush will explain the genesis and meaning of the Taiwan Relations Act, a 1979 domestic law that is frequently referenced but apparently not often read. Bush has consistently explained that the TRA is not the functional equivalent of a defense treaty. As we mark 45 years since the TRA’s passage, he will explain how it was drafted and why it matters despite saying “less than meets the eye.”

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

        This study is based on a database encompassing all instances of political succession in imperial China, constructed by the speaker from a large collection of historical sources. The analysis reveals that only half of the designated successors in the two millennia of imperial Chinese history successfully ascended to power. These divergent outcomes are best explained by the age of the ruling monarch, the age gap between the ruling monarch and the designated successor, and the presence or absence of powerful officials at court. These findings the conventional wisdom that uses primogeniture to explain political succession and instead emphasizes the influence of non-institutional factors.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.

        Talks in Chinese Humanities

Composer Liza Lim and librettist Beth Yahp describe their operaYuè Ling Jié(Moon Spirit Feasting), commissioned by and premiered at the 2000 Adelaide International Festival of the Arts, as a ‘Chinese ritual street opera’. The work is based on Lim and Yahp’s research in 1999 into street performances surrounding the ‘Hungry Ghost Festival’ in Penang, Malaysia. There, Chinese communities address and feed the ghosts that have been released from the underworld during the 7th lunar month of the Chinese calendar using street shrines of offerings and entertainments to appease unpredictable forces and renew social bonds. Lim and Yahp bring these ritual structures into a confrontation with the stories of an adjacent festival celebrating Chang-O, the moon goddess (Autumn Moon Festival), focussing on questions of subjecthood and more-than-human voicing to explode notions of ‘Chineseness’. The opera moves through polyasporic spaces wherein Penang street culture is re-imagined and literally transported to Australia, to Europe, Japan and back to Australia. Lim and Yahp will discuss aspects of the ‘polyasporic’ experience – travelling cultures and memory, ghostly autotopography, for example – in relation to the composition of the music and libretto as well as the work’s reception across the opera’s 6 seasons of performances (2000-2006).
