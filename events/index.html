- Abstract: Professor Chen Zhi’sFrom Ritualization to Secularization: The Shaping of the Book of Songstakes palaeography and linguistics as its starting points and draws in focus on musical archaeology and ethnomusicology. It makes fresh explanation of the multi-faceted origins and historical evolution ofThe Book of Songsin all their aspects. The compilation ofThe Book of Songsstems from conflict and compromise between Shang and Zhou culture, which experienced a complex and lengthy journey from ritualization to secularization and from standardization to regionalization.
Taking inspiration from the process of translating from Chinese into Japanese, Professor Yoshinobu Yuki, in addition to introducing how to deal with issues including those of cultural adaption, will also discuss how historically the Japanese have treated Chinese culture and characters, and in the future, how matters of cultural exchange between the Japanese and Chinese could be addressed.

        将来自英国的文明元素搬到北美大陆的主要“搬运工们”，是来自“五月花号”上的那些清教徒？还是那些率先在弗吉尼亚创立第一个北美殖民地的人们？
美国是幸运的，因为它有了来自英伦三岛的法治文明的种子，因为它在一块天然没有皇帝和国王的土地上实践了契约精神，因为那些天才的建国者们设计了一套日后让那些平庸的普通人也可以运用的制度体系。为此，整个世界，整个现代政治文明，都从中得到了启蒙。

        Ever since Chiang Kai-shek led Kuomintang forces across the Taiwan Strait in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party has aimed for Taiwan's unification with the Chinese mainland. By contrast, Japan has never articulated a defense policy regarding Taiwan. Although the Taiwan issue has become central to security in the Pacific, Japan continues to avoid any direct reference to Taiwan. The 2022 National Security Strategy identified China as Japan's greatest strategic challenge, hinting at likely significant changes in Japanese defense policy in the future. This talk will examine Japan's defense policy toward Taiwan and the implications of a Chinese military unification of Taiwan for Japan.

        The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, now in force in 103 countries, was adopted to prevent a parent from unlawfully removing or retaining a child across an international border. Joining the Convention and accepting its fundamental premises has been difficult for some Asian countries, including Japan. It has forced a shift in mindset about the respective custodial rights of parents in countries with different cultural and societal norms from many Western countries. Two leading experts on the Convention, Yuko Nishitani, professor of law at Kyoto University in Japan, and Linda Silberman, NYU professor of law, will discuss these and other challenges to the operation of the Convention in Japan and the United States as well as other recent global trends.

- Abstract: Were metallurgical technologies homegrown or did they come into China from outside? This question has consistently received the scrutiny of archaeologists and metallurgists. From the 1940s to the present, discussion has ebbed and flowed but reaching a definitive conclusion has proved difficult. Archaeological finds in recent years have furnished new evidence supporting a Chinese origin and outlined subsequent early developments, as well as providing new perspectives from which to view the issue and new avenues to investigate. Grounded in these discoveries, this paper devises a roadmap for systematic exploration and analysis of a proposed Chinese origin and its early development but considers that the weight of archaeological evidence still supports the view that metallurgical technologies entered China from the Eurasian steppe.
This paper focuses on the following three issues: 1. The advent of Old-World metallurgical technologies and their diffusion across the Eurasian steppe; 2. The excavation of early bronze artifacts and vestigial evidence of smelting and casting in northwest China; and 3. The development of early Chinese metallurgical technologies and their link to cultures of the Eurasian steppe. It considers that in the third millennium BCE, manufactured metal artifacts entered northwestern China from the Eurasian steppe, and relevant metallurgical technologies followed in their wake, and furthermore that in approximately the early second millennium BCE, they began a process of transformation into an indigenous practice. Subsequently, metallurgical technologies continued their diffusion eastwards entering north China and the central plains. This process of indigenous evolution gathered pace, especially given the stimulus of systems of Chinese ritual practice, leading to the formulation of a uniquely individual technology of composite earthenware mould casting, which in one fell swoop established a foundation for the magnificent culture of bronze artifacts of the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

        “In front of our eyes was a dark and deathly-still ghost town, with nary a pedestrian or automobile in sight. All around the courtyards, restaurants, and dance halls, those bustling crowds, the once-boisterous music, and thousands of neon lights that lit up the evenings had disappeared, and all that was left was a cold, lonely, and faded city.” So reflected Huang Shiming 黃時明 (aka. Ng Xibeng;nom de plumeTie Ge 鐡戈), a Cambodia-born and locally-recruited Khmer-Chinese Central Investigation Department (調查部; CID) intelligence officer, in his memoirWaves through the Mekong River: A Faithful Record of the Khmer Rouge(逐浪湄河: 紅色高棉實錄). Few records of what Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intelligence operations entailed during the Mao years exist, and virtually all state records and documents on China-Cambodia affairs remain officially “classified in perpetuity” (永久保密). As such, there has been little scholarship to date on CCP intelligence operations at home and abroad, and no extant study of the role that Chinese intelligence operations played in spreading Maoism globally.

An important site where Maoism took root was Cambodia, where CCP intelligence and propaganda work sowed seeds of Maoist fanaticism beyond the Mainland. How did the CID, operating out of its headquarters in the People’s Republic of China Embassy in Phnom Penh, foment Maoist zeal among overseas Chinese (華僑) communities and China-curious activist-intellectuals in Cambodia? I argue that the CID’s three-pronged strategy of local recruitment, community outreach, and cultural revolution-style agitprop via the popular Chinese-language newspaper,Sino-Khmer Daily(棉華日報),spurred Maoist ardor first among ethnic Chinese, then among Cambodian intellectuals. Enthused by radical materials and Phnom Penh’s radical urban culture of the 1960s, overseas Chinese and Khmer progressive alike flocked to join the ethnic Chinese revolutionary movement (華運) and Khmer Rouge, respectively. To trace this link, I highlight three hitherto overlooked primary sources that shed light on the mechanisms and praxes of global Maoism: memoirs of two Cambodia-based CID intelligence agents, Vita Chieu 周德高 and Huang Shiming; and an archival collection of popular overseas Chinese Cambodian newspapers, one title of which operated as the PRC Embassy’s official propaganda outlet (事事昕命於中國大使館的宣傳媒體). In drawing from these rich resources, this project fills long-standing gaps in the study of CCP intelligence work abroad, the methodology of global Maoism, and the modern history of Cambodia’s Chinese communities.

        The age-old challenge of food security used to be dominated by concisely-defined national and international policies for agriculture, hunger eradication, food distribution, and safety nets for emergencies. The older field is being reshaped in the 21st century with the convergence of climate change, biotechnology, geopolitics, and a political economy that contends with a dominance of multinational corporations. The new landscape demands more capacious frameworks for understanding food security—frameworks that simultaneously contend with local, national, and international measures; integrate environmental, animal, and human health; and bring into conversation the political economy of poverty eradication with climate change. Indeed, the Ukraine-Russia war vividly illustrates the need for more capacious frameworks for conceptualizing food security. The war has had a direct impact on food supplies and prices but also subsequently on debt and inflation worldwide, especially in the poorest countries. 

Panelists will take on the challenge of deliberating on frameworks for food security by discussing the state of global food security; China’s and India’s domestic food security policies; and the influence of China and India on global institutions such as the Food and Agricultural Organization.

        Tibet’s incorporation into the People’s Republic of China in the 1950s is a familiar historical event, but why and how did Beijing do it? Speculative answers have been plentiful but empirical investigations can be done only recently. Dr. Xiaoyuan Liu will talk about his most recent book, To the End of Revolution: The Chinese Communist Party and Tibet, 1949-1959, which is the first archive-based study of the subject. The book reveals the thinking, debating, and power maneuvering around the Tibetan question within the inner circles of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)from Beijing to Lhasa. Questions explored in the book include how the CCP differed from its Manchu and Nationalist predecessors in dealing with Tibet, how “unique” Tibet was in Mao Zedong’s revolutionary strategy, how “patient” the CCP leadership was when trying to solve the Tibetan question, and so on. In the Cold War years, Tibet was also part of a new “minority relationship” between China and the United States. In the remaining of his talk, Dr. Liu will briefly discuss his current research project on how the supposedly domestic issue of ethnic or racial minorities in the Chinese and the American societies entered the two powers’ ideological and geopolitical maneuverings.

Lecture 2: The Fates of the Last Rulers of the Warring States
2023/10/13 │ 16:00 – 17:30
It has been argued that we know little about what happened to these rulers with the exception of the famous story of Heir Dan of Yan. Yet Han-dynasty texts like the Shiji and the Han shu as well as the accounts in the Zizhi tongjian and Ming and Qing literary works reveal much about these royal clans and their descendants. This lecture will attempt to select several examples from these last rulers to show that we can postulate in more detail some of their fates.

        Stopping “Gray Rhinos”, Handling “Black Swans” and Removing “Tigers Blocking the Way”: Assessing Challenges and Exploring Prospects for U.S.-China Relations in 2024

Four months after a wayward surveillance blew his impending visit off course, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing to set about erecting the ‘guardrails’ U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping envisaged in Bali in November 2022. Secretary Blinken was followed in quick succession by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Special Climate Envoy John Kerry, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Reciprocally, Beijing’s new Ambassador to the U.S. Xie Feng continues to adjust to his new role, appointed in March, and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi is anticipated to formally visit Washington in the coming months. With this uptick and revival of in-person visits, the United States and China appear to be inching closer to stabilizing their rocky relationship; a goal that both nations have emphasized this year. As the two sides return to their Bali agenda, a critical next step will be to translate their mutual intentions into real actions.

Is that possible at this late hour in the Biden administration’s term in office? Can the two sides take specific steps to resolutely stop “gray rhinos”, properly handle “black swans” and thoroughly remove “tigers blocking the way”, and thus create conditions and remove disruptions for stabilizing U.S.-China relations? Or with election season looming, is the exchange of good intentions about the best that can be expected from the two sides? Will the window to stabilize ties shut tight by the end of the year as election polemics kick-in and China is used as a beating stick by the Biden administration’s political opponents? What does 2024 portend for U.S.-China relations, both politically and on the economic decoupling front?

        In 1932, a group of leftist poets in Shanghai established the China Poetry Society, aiming to produce poetry that would enlighten and mobilize the masses to be the self-conscious political subject. This talk revisits the poetic works and theories of the members of the Society, focusing in particular on the extensive discussion on the historical origin and political relevance of poetic rhythm and its relationship with labor. Tracking the transnational circulation and transformation of the new knowledge of bodily rhythm and poetic rhythm since the late 19th century, this talk shows how a new conception of poetic rhythm as a mediating and mobilizing device gave rise to a series of leftist poetic experiments that attempted to construct the collective political subject through invoking the bodily solidarity of the laboring masses.

        For the last seven decades, world politics has been dominated by American leadership, the institutions it has designed, and putatively liberal norms. This international order is facing severe challenges due to the rise of new powers, breakdown of old economic arrangements, and a redistribution of technological and infrastructural activity. This academic year, we are planning a series of panels that seek to examine emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older international order.

The November 2nd panel there will be a panel that discusses how global governance institutions reflect changing geopolitics and international political economy. We hope to deliberate on the impact of new powers like China, India, and other countries in the global South, and how they are leading to new distributions of power, norms, and expertise.

        In 1945, researchers in Hiroshima with the US Strategic Bombing Survey canvassed survivors of the nuclear attack. This marked the beginning of global efforts—by psychiatrists, psychologists, and other social scientists—to tackle the complex ways human minds were affected by the advent of the nuclear age. Nuclear Minds traces these efforts and the different ways they were interpreted across communities of researchers and victims. The manuscript explores how the bomb’s psychological impact on survivors was understood before the idea of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In fact, psychological and psychiatric research on Hiroshima and Nagasaki rarely referred to trauma or similar categories. Instead, institutional, and political constraints—most notably the psychological sciences’ entanglement with Cold War science—led researchers to concentrate on short-term damage and somatic reactions or even led, in some cases, to denying victim suffering.Very few doctors tried to ameliorate suffering. But the professions did not “fail” to diagnose PTSD (a non-existent category at the time). Rather, doctors and survivors understood and experienced psychological suffering and their role in society differently. This is clear by comparing the nuclear case with those of the Holocaust, military veterans, and other victims. This book analyzes the historical, cultural, and scientific constraints under which researchers and victims acted. And it explores how suffering was understood in different cultural contexts before PTSD became a category of analysis.

        In this talk, I propose a theory of Buddhist “para-charisma” by analyzing the case of an iconoclastic monk in Vietnam. My argument draws from twenty months of ethnographic research conducted in Ho Chi Minh City between 2015 and 2019. During fieldwork, I was introduced to a highly respected monk with the extraordinary capacity to read minds and perceive karmic obstacles in the lives of his lay and monastic followers. This monk was unique for his open consumption of meat and alcohol, lay clothing, and use of insults in preaching. These behaviors had the deliberate effect of creating an uncomfortable, tense social environment among his visitors. Later, the nun who had introduced us explained that his harsh language and adversariall demeanor were a rare form of compassion that urged immediate awakening to Buddhist teachings. I compare this case with previously developed theories of Buddhist charisma and moral aesthetics. While past studies analyze Buddhist charisma through the moral aesthetics of physical beauty or affective responses of tranquility, gratitude, and awe, my theory of para-charisma shows how some monks can deliberately use repulsive behavior and negative affects to attract followers and advance spiritual goals.
