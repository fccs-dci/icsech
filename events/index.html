        The ‘nation of cities’ may well be a fitting epithet for China today. There are hundreds of cities in China with more than one million population. The Pearl River delta has become a region of megacities. From Upper Yangtze in the South West to the entire east China, modern cities have sprung up in ways that nearly obliterate the country’s agrarian past. How did China become a predominantly urban society in a span of four decades since the reforms? Literature on China’s urban development focusing on town planning, manufacturing and factory towns, or migration do not explain this urbanization story. The talk would provide a retrospective perspective to understand urban development in contemporary China. The origins of China’s urban development can be traced back to imperial era country capitals, river basin cities, coastal towns and the traditional walled cities. Besides, the geographical concentration of China’s urbanization still largely corresponds to historical urban regions of the east. The great rivers of Huang he, Chang Jiang and Zhu jiang are home to vast urban populations. The speaker would argue that China’s urban development in the post-reform era, is in part a derivative outcome from the cities in history that precedes the imperial period.

        A webinar on the impact of post-Covid economic conditions and strategic competition between China and the West, with Economist George Magnus.

For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines China and the West's mutual disengagement in the context of a post zero-Covid economy, by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnusis an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.

        Can a sophisticated financial market exist without legal protections for investors and creditors? International investors have put trillions of dollars into “China concepts stocks” and Chinese-issued international bonds over the past two decades, even though these markets to some extent operate extra-legally. In a new paper, Professor Shitong Qiao examines how this anomalous situation came about and the mechanism by which the Chinese state’s reputation has functioned as an alternative to legal protections. In this talk, he will explain how China governs by extra-legality and suggest that this is a new direction for research by scholars of law, social norms, and development.Professor Roderick Hills, U.S.-Asia Law Institute Faculty Advisor, will moderate.

General Secretary Xi Jinping further consolidated his power into an all-powerful empire at the CCP 20th National Congress. How has the leadership lineup changed CCP elite politics? How has Xi reached this point of power? What are the foreign policy implications of Xi’s power concentration? Suisheng Zhao will explore these questions in a talk based on his new book, The Dragon Roars Back: Transformational Leaders and Dynamics of Chinese Foreign Policy, which argues that the unique visions and political wisdom of transformational leaders have been game-changers in Chinese foreign policy.

        This event is part of a new Chinese Culture Lecture Series organised by the Manchester China Institute and Manchester Museum.

Dr. Sunny Xin Liu and Professor of Public History and broadcaster, Michael Wood will unite for this intimate discussion about Dr. Liu's latest book, &quot;Anglo-Chinese Encounters Before the Opium War, A Tale Of Two Empires Over Two Centuries&quot; (Routledge, 2022).

Starting with Queen Elizabeth I’s letter to the Ming Emperor Wanli and ending with the letter from Lord Palmerston to the Minister of China just before the Opium War, this talk narrates the fascinating encounters between the two historic empires and explores the long journey from cultural diplomacy to gunboat diplomacy.

In this special event at the Historic Reading Room of the John Rylands Research Institute and Library, the speakers will adopt a novel ‘mirror’ approach by pairing and comparing people, texts, gifts, commodities, artworks, architecture, ideologies, operating systems and world views of the two empires. While interweaving the most known diplomatic efforts at the official level with the much unknown intellectual interactions at the people-to-people level, this approach allows an analysis of how the two empires created frameworks for understanding “Self and Other” from both Sino-centric and Anglo-centric points of departure, telling stories that have been understudied in the grand narratives, and reflecting on their implications on today’s bilateral relations.

The event also marks the opening of the new China Culture Gallery at the Manchester Museum, where various narratives on historical Anglo-Chinese encounters will also be exhibited.

        For much of the twentieth century, Chinese governments pursued two distinct forms of developmentalism. A “globalist” paradigm emphasized machine technologies, fossil fuels, technocratic knowledge, and capital mobilization, while an “involutionary” approach depended on low-tech, labor-intensive, and cost-minimizing strategies. Both imposed a very high environmental cost, and neither reckoned with the importance of non-human actors such as minerals, soil, water, animals, and microbes. This lecture will explore the dilemmas of development in the early 20th century using the Hanyeping coal and iron mines （汉冶萍公司）as a case study. I will describe how rocks and bugs impeded the state’s pursuit of globalist development in the Hanyeping venture, causing an array of political and diplomatic problems for the late imperial and early Republican regimes. At a methodological level, I will explain why scholars need to take seriously the agency of these kinds of non-human Others even when exploring subjects outside of environmental history.

        Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine one year ago, Japan has begun significantly upgrading its national security posture. It announced plans to double defense-related expenditures to equal 2 percent of GDP in five years and updated three of its key national security documents. Meanwhile, Japan and the US have strengthened their alliance through a Biden-Kishida summit at the White House and a series of meetings between their top economic policy and security/defense teams. What is Japan’s goal, and what other steps may be necessary to harden the resilience of its supply chains for goods, energy, and food? Professor Kanehara of Doshisha University, who helped formulate security policy while serving as assistant chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from 2012 to 2019, will discuss the role Japan should play in the alliance with the US and share his comprehensive view of security from a geopolitical perspective.

        Cooperation in higher education has been one of the foundational elements in US-China relations. Today, there are over 350,000 students from the PRC studying in undergraduate and graduate programs across the US. In addition, over the course of four decades, US and Chinese universities have built up an array of collaborative research projects that have resulted in a growing number of publications in top tier refereed journals. The relationship in higher education seemed to be of substantial benefit to both sides, even if there have been shifts in geopolitical currents and a variety of on-going issues to be resolved.

Most recently, however, with the souring of the overall bilateral political relationship, the bilateral higher educational relationship has encountered numerous challenges. The number of US students wanting to study in China has declined, and the number of Chinese students willing to come to the US also has diminished. For many PRC students, getting a visa to come to the US has proven increasingly problematic because of tighter US controls. Research collaboration also has declined precipitously because of growing national security and competitiveness concerns. It seems as if things are moving in a downward spiral with no bottom in sight. The proposed panel will examine evolving trends and developments regarding US-China university cooperation and exchanges. The experienced panelists will offer their frank assessment about the prospects for the future, commenting on those forces that will shape the bilateral higher education relationship in both the short and medium-to-long term.

        On Tuesday, February 28, 2023, at 5p.m. PT, the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Wei-Ping Lin to discuss her newly published work,Island Fantasia: Imagining Subjects on the Military Frontline between China and Taiwan. This is a virtual event which will be livestreamed on our Facebook and YouTube pages.Click here to register.

The Matsu archipelago between China and Taiwan, for long an isolated outpost off southeast China, was suddenly transformed into a military frontline in 1949 by the Cold War and the Communist–Nationalist conflict. The army occupied the islands, commencing more than 40 long years of military rule. With the lifting of martial law in 1992, the people were confronted with the question of how to move forward. Professor Lin’s in-depth ethnography and social history of the islands focuses on how individual citizens redefined themselves and reimagined their society. Drawing on long-term fieldwork, Lin shows how islanders used both traditional and new media to cope with the conflicts and trauma of harsh military rule. She discusses the formation of new social imaginaries through the appearance of “imagining subjects,” interrogating their subjectification processes and varied uses of mediating technologies as they seek to answer existential questions.

        This roundtable features a research project that moves beyond canonical textual sources to advance the study of Daoism through archaeological and epigraphic materials, including statues, stele inscriptions, cave shrines, temple inscriptions, and inscribed tomb epitaphs. By using these understudied sources to augment the canonical sources these speakers will seek to further understand the social history of Daoism and explore developments and changes in ritual practices that are often invisible in the canonical records. These materials are located in various sites in China and the temporal spread of the project is from the 5th to the 17h century. Collectively, these presentations help us understand how the Daoist faith was lived and experienced in everyday life.

        HOW DOMESTIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL POLITICS SHAPE CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

        A conversation between Prof William Hurst and Prof Pete Gries on how both domestic and foreign policy shapes China in IR.

Most international relations scholarship ignores or oversimplifies the role of domestic politics. Conversely, most analysis of domestic politics, even in reference to the making and implementation of foreign policy, downplays or occludes the influence of international factors. Only by looking at the two in tandem can we make significant headway. Ruling governing coalitions make foreign policy largely to advance domestic political aims and agendas, but they do so in international structural environments that incentivise and constrain their strategies and behaviour.

By looking at China’s relationships with the United States and several Southeast Asian countries over time, I propose a theory of interaction between domestic and international factors to explain the dynamics of Chinese foreign policy and international relations more broadly.

        The Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984 and transferred control of Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China from 1 July 1997. This set the scene for the establishment of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) in Hong Kong. Lim uses British archival sources to re-examine the Joint Declaration, the negotiations that led up to it and its resounding significance. Beginning with Margaret Thatcher’s preparations for her Beijing trip, his recent book, Treaty for a Lost City: The Sino-British Joint Declaration (Cambridge University Press, 2022) takes a chronological approach. In light of current developments, Lim will set out to explain some of the legal complexities that have underpinned the relationships between China, Hong Kong and Britain since 1979.

        This talk introducesImperial Gateway, which explores the political, social, and economic significance of colonial Taiwan in the southern expansion of Japan's empire from 1895 to the end of World War II. The book uncovers a half century of dynamic relations between Japan, Taiwan, China, and Western regional powers. Japanese officials in Taiwan did not simply take orders from Tokyo; rather, they often pursued their own expansionist ambitions in South China and Southeast Asia. When outright conquest was not possible, they promoted alternative strategies, including naturalizing resident Chinese as overseas Taiwanese subjects, extending colonial police networks, and deploying tens of thousands of Taiwanese to war. The Taiwanese—merchants, gangsters, policemen, interpreters, nurses, and soldiers—seized new opportunities for socioeconomic advancement that did not always align with Japan's imperial interests.Imperial Gatewayshows how Japanese officials and Taiwanese subjects transformed Taiwan into a regional gateway for expansion in an ever-shifting international order.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s



Book Talk with Chien-Wen Kung (National University of Singapore)

*﻿RSVP requested

The UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Chien-Wen Kung to discuss his newly published monograph, Diasporic Cold Warriors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Philippine Chinese were Southeast Asia and possibly the world’s most exemplary overseas Chinese Cold Warriors. Fears of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Southeast Asia’s Chinese as conduits for PRC influence gripped states and societies then – as indeed they do today. Yet, ironically, the example of the Philippines shows that the &quot;China&quot; which intervened the most extensively in any Southeast Asian country during the Cold War was not the PRC. It was, rather, the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. Drawing upon archival research and fieldwork in Taiwan, the Philippines, the United States, and China, Diasporic Cold Warriors tells for the first time this story of the Philippine Chinese as anticommunist partisans by tracing their evolving relationship with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Philippine state over the middle third of the 20th century.

Chien-Wen Kung is an Assistant Professor of History at the National University of Singapore and the author of Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s. His scholarship has also been published in Modern Asian Studies, the International History Review, and Asian Ethnicity. Born and raised in Singapore, he received his B.A. in History and English from Dartmouth College and Ph.D. in Modern Chinese and International and Global History from Columbia University. With funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and National Heritage Board in Singapore, he is currently working on a cultural history of Singapore-China-Taiwan relations in the 1970s and 1980s.

        The King’s Road offers a new interpretation of the history of the Silk Road, emphasizing its importance as a diplomatic route, rather than a commercial one. Tracing the arduous journeys of diplomatic envoys, Xin Wen presents a rich social history of long-distance travel that played out in deserts, post stations, palaces, and polo fields. The book tells the story of the everyday lives of diplomatic travelers on the Silk Road—what they ate and drank, the gifts they carried, and the animals that accompanied them—and how they navigated a complex web of geographic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. It also describes the risks and dangers envoys faced along the way—from financial catastrophe to robbery and murder. Using documents unearthed from the famous Dunhuang “library cave” in Western China, The King’s Road paints a detailed picture of the intricate network of trans-Eurasian transportation and communication routes that was established between 850 and 1000 CE.

By exploring the motivations of the kings who dispatched envoys along the Silk Road and describing the transformative social and economic effects of their journeys, the book reveals the inner workings of an interstate network distinct from the Sino-centric “tributary” system. In shifting the narrative of the Silk Road from the transport of commodities to the exchange of diplomatic gifts and personnel, The King’s Road puts the history of Eastern Eurasia in a new light.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

N﻿OTE:This is a hybrid-format talk. You can join us in person at the Manchester China Institute as well as virtually, via Zoom. Please book your free ticket accordingly.
