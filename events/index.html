        Henry Huiyao Wang is the Founder and President of the Center for China and Globalization (CCG), a top 64th global think tank ranked by the University of Pennsylvania and accredited with UN NGO “Special Consultative Status.” Dr. Wang is former Counselor to the China State Council, China’s cabinet, a global thought leader on China and globalization, global governance, international trade and investment, global migration and talent flows, China’s international relations and China-U.S. trade relations, with more than 100 publications in both Chinese and English.

The speaker will focus on how China’s 40 years of development has changed the world. His remarks will be divided into three parts: 1) Unprecedented transformation of China since 1979; 2) China’s role in the world via its gradual integration into the current global system; and 3) China’s participation in global governance, especially its effort to engage with international institutions by proposing new agendas to the international community. 

In a context in which globalization has been retreating for years, China’s contribution to globalization is always underestimated, given that populism and unilateralism are prevailing in many countries. Sometimes China is accused of taking advantage of other countries. We must therefore seek insight to find a proper interpretation of China’s rise. 

In addition, reassessing China’s dramatic rise and its interaction with the world may inspire us to address current global problems in a balanced fashion, rather than simply blaming China as a scapegoat. Instead of probing the external environment that has accommodated China’s rapid growth, the speaker will take a unique perspective by emphasizing the impact of China’s internal momentum on its rise.

Moderator: Wei Victor Huang, Chair and Professor of Finance, UHM College of Business. His research interests include Chinese financial markets and corporate governance, and international finance. He is the author of dozens of articles in financial studies, including some that have won prizes and special recognition in both the US and China. 

This talk is co-sponsored by the UHM Shidler College of Business and the Center for China and Globalization.

        A CONVERSATION WITH MARIA REPNIKOVA ON CHINESE SOFT POWER

      </p></div><div><p class="line-clamp-5 text-sm text-gray-900 mt-4">
        This conversational event will draw on key points from Dr. Repnikova’s latest book, Chinese Soft Power (Cambridge University Press, 2022), which unpacks China’s visions and practices of soft power both domestically, and internationally. Analysing a variety of soft-power mechanisms, the research traces both their official motivations and how they operate across global contexts.

The talk will continue by examining how soft power carries different meanings in China, and how its application should not be seen through a binary lens of success or failure. Instead, the speaker would argue that we should treat Chinese initiatives as ambitious in scale and adaptive to local contexts, but also as contested or perceived with mixed credibility by global audiences.

        The history of pre-Qin Classical Chinese thought is usually woven around a small set of great philosophers, each taken as the authorial voice behind a single text: Kongzi (the Lunyu), Laozi (Daodejing), Mozi, Mengzi, Zhuangzi (the “Inner Chapters” of the Zhuangzi), Xunzi, and Hanfeizi. Does this view of texts and authors fit the reality of how texts were written and formed in early China? Based on archeological evidence from recently excavated texts and greater attention to the role of Han dynasty scholars in editing and forming texts, many scholars of early China have argued that it does not. In this faculty dialogue, Tao Jiang, Esther Sunkyung Klein, and Franklin Perkins will explore the implications of that conclusion for how we should read and interpret classical Chinese philosophical texts. 

Tao Jiang is Professor of Chinese and Buddhist Philosophies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. He is the author ofOrigins of Moral-Political Philosophy in Early China(Oxford 2021) andContexts and Dialogue: Yogācāra Buddhism and Modern Psychology on the Subliminal Mind(Hawaii 2006). Jiang is chair of Religion Department and director of Center for Chinese Studies at Rutgers.

Esther Sunkyung Klein (PhD Princeton, East Asian Studies 2010) is Senior Lecturer at The Australian National University. She researches pre-modern Chinese thought, including both the philosophical and historical traditions. She has published on the authorship of theZhuangzi, ideas of the historian as author in relation to theShiji,epistemology in Han dynasty thought.

Franklin Perkins is Professor of Philosophy at UHM and editor of the journal Philosophy East and West. His main research interests are in classical Chinese philosophy, early modern European philosophy, and in the challenges of doing philosophy in a comparative or intercultural context. His most recent book is Doing What You Really Want: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mengzi (Oxford 2021).

        在顾维钧从事外交活动的时代，中国通常是以弱国身份与列强打交道的。这一境况十分考验中国外交尤其是外交官的应对。弱国有无外交？弱国如何外交？这是民国年间中国面对列强的一大问题。顾维钧对中国的国力有清醒的认识，承认弱国这一事实，但在与列强交涉时，有理有节，不自卑更不胆怯，为国家争权益也赢得尊重。弱国外交的应对不仅仅要处理与列强打交道的问题，还要面对国内民众的要求和呼声，这同样考验外交官的智慧和勇气，也影响中国与外部世界的关系。本次讲座将通过顾维钧与巴黎和会、国联、中英新约谈判和旧金山会议等具体事例展现并讨论他的外交应对之道。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道，观看本次讲座。

        Real estate has had a vast influence on China's economy. In particular, real estate has taken a massive role across China's financial system — accounting for an estimated 70 percent of Chinese households' assets, 30 percent of local governments’ revenues, and almost 30 percent of all outstanding bank loans before the pandemic. As China's real estate sector faces a sharp crisis, what are the implications for the financial system and the financial health of China's broader economy? What are China’s debt risks as real estate prices plateau or fall?

Please join experts on China's financial sector for this discussion. This event is the second in a series on China's real estate sector and its broader economic effects.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.

        China’s overseas economic activity is diversifying beyond official development finance from its two main policy banks, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China. Despite the array of various debt, equity and grant financing mechanisms China’s policy banks have at their disposal, separate multi-stakeholder funds have emerged that are increasing Chinese financing capacity for overseas development projects. Since the mid-2000s, Chinese public and private financing institutions have established specialized investment funds that primarily provide equity financing to sector and region-specific development projects. These 'Overseas Development Investment Funds' (ODIFs) are an increasingly mentioned feature of Chinese foreign direct investment and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) financing instruments. Drawing on forthcoming research, Oyintarelado (Tarela) Moses, Data Analyst and Database Manager for the Global China Initiative at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and Laura Gormley, Research Assistant to the Global China Initiative, will explore the unique features, financing capacity, policy implications and future potential of China’s ODIFs.

Join us on Tuesday, November 8, for a discussion on diversifying the BRI with China’s ODIFs. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        CHINA’S NEXT ACT: HOW SUSTAINABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY ARE RESHAPING CHINA

        If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that the world is bound together by shared challenges—and that at the center of those challenges stands China. Thanks to decades of breakneck growth and development, Chinese officials, businesses, and institutions now play a critical role in every major global issue, from climate change to biotechnology. China’s Next Act re-envisions China’s role in the world in terms of sustainability and technology. This reframing is essential both because none of these increasingly pressing, shared global challenges can be tackled without China, and because they are reshaping China’s economy and its foreign policy, with major implications for the world at large. At the same time, sustainability and technology issues present opportunities for intensified economic, geopolitical, and ideological competition—a reality that Beijing recognizes.

The danger is that China’s next act will drive divergence on the rules and standards the world desperately needs to tackle shared challenges in the decades ahead. In some areas, like clean technology development, competition can be good for the planet. But in others, it could be catastrophic: only cooperation can lower the risks of artificial intelligence and other disruptive new technologies.

The challenges posed by climate change, pandemics, and emerging technologies make dealing with China’s state, its firms, and other institutions more complex and more critical than ever before. China’s Next Act helps foreign countries, companies, and other organizations prepare for a future shaped by sustainability, technology—and a dramatic new chapter for China and the world.

        Today American institutions dominate nearly every major ranking of global universities. Yet in historical terms, America’s preeminence is relatively new, and there is no reason to assume that U.S. schools will continue to lead the world a century from now. Indeed, America’s supremacy in higher education is under great stress, particularly at its public universities. At the same time Chinese universities are on the ascent. Thirty years ago, Chinese institutions were reopening after the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution; today they are some of the most innovative educational centers in the world. Will China threaten American primacy?

Empires of Ideas looks to the past two hundred years for answers, chronicling two revolutions in higher education: the birth of the research university and its integration with the liberal education model. William C. Kirbyexamines the successes of leading universities—The University of Berlin and the Free University of Berlin in Germany; Harvard, Duke, and the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States—to determine how they rose to prominence and what threats they currently face. Kirby draws illuminating comparisons to the trajectories of three Chinese contenders: Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, and the University of Hong Kong, which aim to be world-class institutions that can compete with the best the United States and Europe have to offer. But Chinese institutions also face obstacles. Kirby analyzes the challenges that Chinese academic leaders must confront: reinvesting in undergraduate teaching, developing new models of funding, and navigating a political system that may undermine a true commitment to free inquiry and academic excellence.

In this MCI webinar, Prof. Kirby will delve deeper into the key points of his acclaimed book and participate in a Q&amp;amp;A session subsequent to the talk.

        A BIRD IN THE CAGE? PUBLIC COURT TRANSCRIPTS AND LITIGATION IN CHINA

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        Dr Bingchun Meng has written extensively about Chinese social media and its subjects. She provides a profound analysis of topics such as knowledge production, gender research and power structure, social science studies standpoints and academic awareness in different social contexts in China and the West. Her recent publication, The Politics of Chinese Media: Consensus and Contestation (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), offers an analytical account of the consensus and contestations of the politics of Chinese media at both institutional and discursive levels. It considers the formal politics of how the Chinese state manages political communication internally and externally in the post-socialist era, and examines the politics of news media, focusing particularly on how journalists navigate the competing demands of the state, the capital and the urban middle class readership. The book also addresses the politics of entertainment media, in terms of how power operates upon and within media culture, and the politics of digital networks, highlighting how the Internet has become the battlefield of ideological contestation while also shaping how political negotiations are conducted. Bearing in mind the contemporary relevance of China’s socialist revolution, this text challenges both the liberal universalist view that presupposes ‘the end of history’ and various versions of China exceptionalism, which downplay the impact of China’s integration into global capitalism.

        The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the public finances of African countries. It also led to rising debt levels in many African countries and has increased concerns about their ability to make their scheduled sovereign debt payments over the next few years. This looming debt crisis raises questions about how these countries can most effectively manage their debts and how their creditors can help them develop in sustainable and inclusive ways. Daniel Bradlow, SARCHI Professor of International Development Law and African Economic Relations at the University of Pretoria, and Magalie Masamba, Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria, will present key findings from the 2021 book, “COVID-19 and Sovereign Debt: The Case of SADC”, a multi-disciplinary publication focusing on the issue of African sovereign debt management and renegotiation/restructuring in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

Join us on Tuesday, December 13, for a discussion on COVID-19, sovereign debt and the case of the SADC region. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnus is an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.
