        This talk will explore how Beethoven became an iconic figure in the People’s Republic of China and consider the role that his music, and classical music in general, has played in China’s internal politics and diplomatic relationships. The Philadelphia Orchestra’s history, and example, as a bridge builder between the US and China will receive particular focus. A conductor, author, and educator with a distinguished career, Jindong Cai is the director of the US-China Music Institute, co-director of the Chinese Music Development Initiative, and professor of music and arts at Bard College. Sheila Melvin is the co-author, with her husband, Jindong Cai, of &quot;Rhapsody in Red: How Western Classical Music Became Chinese,&quot; which was short-listed for the Saroyan Prize in 2005; and &quot;Beethoven in China: How the Great Composer Became an Icon in the People’s Republic&quot; (Penguin, 2016), which was featured on NPR’s “All Things Considered;”

        China’s nuclear arsenal is undergoing the most dramatic modernization since China first acquired nuclear weapons 57 years ago. In addition to increasing road-mobile ballistic missiles, the current phase involves construction of what appears to be more than 300 missile silos, launching additional ballistic missile submarines, as well as adding a nuclear bomber leg to its arsenal. Unlike previous nuclear modernization phases, the current upgrade is highly visible on commercial satellite images, which allows the public to participate in the debate about the nature and implications of Chinese nuclear forces in a way that has never been possible before.

        At the World Trade Organization (WTO), over 110 countries and regions are currently negotiating over investment facilitation for development. The aim is to facilitate foreign direct investment by improving the transparency and efficiency of investment measures and encouraging sustainable investment. This plurilateral initiative is essential to strengthen the rule-making function of the WTO. Kei Tomaru, who as second secretary at the Permanent Mission of Japan in Geneva represents one of the leading countries in the negotiations, and Karl P. Sauvant, resident senior fellow at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, who closely follows these negotiations, will share their views about the negotiation’s importance and prospects.

        The fundamental reason for the extreme leverage today in China’s banks, enterprises and the state itself is found in the decentralized fiscal arrangements of highly self-reliant local governments. This problem has been compounded by the excessive stimulus lending over the past decade. As a result Beijing has promoted the creation of an extensive shadow banking system designed to protect the stability of the major state banks. Stepping back this has led to the state’s growing leverage. This presentation focuses on the impact of the shadow banking system on the state’s finances and compares the costs of China’s response to the global financial crisis with the US response.

        Chinese Buddhists have never remained stationary. They have always been on the move. Why did Buddhist monks migrate from China to Southeast Asia? How did they participate in transregional Buddhist networks across the South China Sea? In this talk, I will tell the story of “South China Sea Buddhism,” referring to a Buddhism that emerged from a swirl of correspondence networks, forced exiles, voluntary visits, evangelizing missions, institution-building campaigns, and organizational efforts of countless Chinese and Chinese diasporic Buddhist monks. Drawing on multilingual research conducted in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, I challenge the conventional categories of “Chinese Buddhism” and “Southeast Asian Buddhism” by focusing on the lesser-known—yet no less significant—Chinese Buddhist communities of maritime Southeast Asia. By crossing the artificial spatial frontier between China and Southeast Asia, this talk brings Southeast Asia into the study of Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism into the study of Southeast Asia.

        Walford Gillison, a missionary son born in Wuhan, was a neutral during China’s war with Japan. He was semi-imprisoned after Pearl Harbor, but a full POW in Yangzhou from March 1942. In his book, he describes everyday life in an over-crowded camp with 600 people. He recounts the food shortage, lack of privacy, steaming summers and below-zero winters. Health was achieved thanks to the dedicated medico-nursing staff in a make-shift hospital. Education was achieved thanks to amazing teachers using minimal equipment. His release was delayed for seven weeks due to political turmoil outside the prison gates. Walford Gillison eventually became a surgeon in the West Midlands before retirement.

        This study examines two cohorts of Chinese international students studying in the U.S. whose privilege is challenged and sometimes upended before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research questions the dominant framing of privilege centering on the notion ofease, as informed by the western scholarship on elite education. Drawing from the power structure of international education and rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, this study concludes that transnational education infuses much anxiety and fragility into the lived experiences of international students, who have experienced the status loss from the privileged majority to the marginalized minority. COVID had exacerbated this loss. This study contributes to the scholarship on elites by interrogating the western-centric notion of privilege.

        In January 2017, John Bolton, foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations advocated that the United States revisit their “One-China policy” and reevaluate their political and military relationship with Taiwan as China had become “increasingly belligerent” in recent years. In addition to increasing military sales to Taiwan, he urged the United States to also interpret the Taiwan Relations Act more broadly and redeploy “at least some” U.S. forces from Okinawa to Taiwan, which would allow Washington to monitor China’s military activities in the South China Sea more closely, and enable the rapid deployment of forces throughout the region “should the need arise.”

Bolton’s hawkish proposal is a provocative response to China’s rising economic and military power, and its antagonism towards Taiwanese nationalism after the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) returned to power in 2016. This also has to be understood as being part of the reshaping of the work project framework under the U.S.-Japan Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty since the re-militarization of Japan in 2015.

In response to the resurgence of Cold War scenarios in the transpacific setting, this talk discusses short stories from the Japanese and Taiwanese-controlled Cold War islands of Okinawa and Kinmen. I will explore how literary representations of Cold War historical experiences and traumatic memories problematize the complicit yet asymmetrical relations between U.S. imperialism, the authorities of Japan and Taiwan, and the local patriarchy. Taking inspiration from Sakai Naoki’s “regime of translation,” I also examine how liminal perspectives and Japanophone/Sinophone articulations in these works illuminate the mechanism of ethno-national identity-making under Cold War politics and its repercussions.

        In recent years, China has grown to be one of the largest providers of outward power development globally through its growing global shares of foreign direct investment (FDI) and development bank finance. Until Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s announcement that China “will not build new coal-fired power plants abroad” in September 2021, China was also one of the few countries that would still support overseas construction of coal-fired power plants. In a new study, Ian Kieffer (with Cecilia Han Springer and Ian Sue Wing) use a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model to assess the potential impact of Xi’s proclamation on global CO2 emissions. The study creates a simulation of a 2030 global economy in which China has replaced predicted coal projects with solar- and wind-based projects across both International Energy Agency and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) development scenarios and analyzes the impacts of such a change in investment strategy in terms of effects on emissions, economic structure and gross domestic product.

On Wednesday, March 16, join Ian Kieffer, Global China Research Fellow with the Boston University Global Development Policy Center and Ian Sue Wing, Professor with the Department of Earth and the Environment at Boston University, for a discussion on China’s clean energy transition abroad. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        Chinese poetry has a long history of interaction with the visual arts. Classical aesthetic thought held that painting, calligraphy, and poetry were cross-fertilizing and mutually enriching. What happened when the Chinese poetic tradition encountered photography, a transformative technology and presumably realistic medium that reshaped seeing and representing the world?

Shengqing Wu explores how the new medium of photography was transformed by Chinese aesthetic culture. She details the complex negotiations between poetry and photography in the late Qing and early Republican eras, examining the ways traditional textual forms collaborated with the new visual culture. Drawing on extensive archival research into illustrated magazines, poetry collections, and vintage photographs, Photo Poetics analyzes a wide range of practices and genres, including self-representation in portrait photography; gifts of inscribed photographs; mass-media circulation of images of beautiful women; and photography of ghosts, immortals, and imagined landscapes. Wu argues that the Chinese lyrical tradition provided rich resources for artistic creativity, self-expression, and embodied experience in the face of an increasingly technological and image-oriented society. An interdisciplinary study spanning literary studies, visual culture, and media history, Photo Poetics is an original account of media culture in early twentieth-century China and the formation of Chinese literary and visual modernities.

        FUNNY MONEY CIRCULATION AND FABRIC EXPORTS FROM CHINA TO DUBAI THROUGH INDIAN TRADING NETWORKS

        Chiefly drawing on his ethnographic fieldwork in the district of Keqiao in Zhejiang Province since 2009, Dr. Cheuk argues that irregular financial transactions — conceptualized as “funny money” in this talk — play a significant role in the sustenance of otherwise tenuous business relations between Indian traders and Chinese suppliers in the China–Dubai fabric trade. Much of the fabric exported from Keqiao to Dubai relies on intertwined formal and informal transactions operated by Indian trading networks. These labyrinthine transnational funny money transactions aim to circumvent institutional hurdles and overcome deficiencies in operating capital, yet inherent to this system is a cycle of payment lags that cause tense relations between payers and payees. Funny money transactions facilitate eventual payment in most cases most of the time and maintain enough trust to keep the trade network alive. Furthermore, the interlocking circuits of funny money also prevent the overaccumulation of wealth and power by any particular stakeholder involved in the international trade and defy or at least circumvent the formal political authority of state and financial institutions that seek to curtail such practices. These transactions thereby create a larger space for business survival among the grassroots players, especially Indian traders who may not have enough capital available when they initiate a deal with a Chinese supplier.

        This talk builds on recent scholarship that takes seriously fantasmatic portrayals of transmutation in Chinese porcelain manufacture. The speaker argues that creative accounts—theatrical and narrative, Chinese and European—position porcelain as a substance hovering on the cusp between life and death, person and thing, animate and inanimate. To do so, she will take you through Chinese materials as diverse as a Ming court opera about the eunuch admiral Zheng He, strange cases of statues that haunt, hagiographies of self-sacrificing artisans who immolate themselves in the kiln, and a stop-motion animation film comprised entirely of porcelain by contemporary artist Geng Xue. The catalyst for the project is the recent performance in New York and Chicago of an 18th century French pantomime-ballet about an evil sorcerer who transforms people into porcelain. This brilliant new production, co-created by art historian Meredith Martin and the choreographer and Asian American activist Phil Chan, reimagines a work from the height of the European chinoiserie craze in a way that both captures the magic of porcelain and addresses current politics of race in the arts for a 21st century audience.

        Over the last decades, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea. China’s economic sanctions may also have long-term effects in deterring and shaping countries’ foreign policy interests that go well beyond the short-term economic costs. The talk will highlight how Taiwan responds to China’s economic sanctions. It demonstrates the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power The second part of this presentation offers initial thoughts on establishing a trade pact in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s unilateral economic sanctions. More specifically, Taiwan and Australia have much to offer the rest of the world regarding how to respond to China’s economic coercion.

        Cabo-Verde-China relations have rapidly developed in the last two decades. China has provided a lot of assistance to this small archipelagic nation located in the Atlantic Ocean, around 400 kilometres west of the Africa continent. Several Chinese companies, including Huawei, are active there. A Confucius Institute has been opened in Praia, the country's capital, and the Chinese government has built and donated a brand new campus to the University of Cabo Verde. Yet, Cabo Verde remains closer to the West, both the United States, which for security reasons is worried about China's inroads, and the European Union which has for a long time established a close partnership with this former Portuguese colony. This presentation will show that small and weak states as Cabo Verde can still enjoy some agency in their relations with great powers, an agency that allows them to balance their relationships and optimise their interests.

        In 2009 the UN, the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC), the Chinese Government and representatives of over a thousand Daoist temples, monasteries and organisations met at the ancient sacred site of Hua Shan. There, the Daoists launched their first eight year plan to combat climate change, address bio-diversity issues and work for a sustainable environment. This event also launched a totally unique way in which Daoism expresses why the forces driving climate change are fundamentally wrong - a view which was later taken up by the UN. It also launched a whole series of practical actions across China - guided, enabled and inspired by Daoism.

In the most recent Five Year Plan of China, the Daoists have been given a central role in civil society programmes on environmental education and action – the first time any faith has been highlighted in any of the Five Year Plans. And later this year a new eight-year Daoist plan will be launched. Martin Palmer, former Secretary General of ARC, religious advisor to HRH The Duke of Edinburgh for 35 years and now CEO of FaithInvest as well as being one of the world’s leading translators of Chinese classics, has worked with the Daoists on environmental issues since 1993.

Martin Palmerwas the Secretary General of the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC) until June 2019. ARC was founded with HRH Prince Philip in 1995 to help faiths develop environmental and conservation projects based on their own beliefs and practices. Although ARC closed in 2019, having achieved its major goals, its legacy includes FaithInvest and WWF's International Beliefs and Values Programme. Martin is an international specialist on all major faiths and religious traditions and cultures. He is the author and editor of more than 20 books on religious and environmental topics. He has translated many ancient Chinese texts, is a regular contributor to the BBC, and is a lay preacher in the Church of England

        “The funeral home was like his second office.” On average, a Taiwanese MP receives 31 requests a week from constituents to attend funerals. Why are voters interested in having MPs present at private funerals? Drawing on evidence from in-depth interviews and observation, this study focuses on the role of guanxi, the Chinese term for particularistic ties. Voters in a guanxi society are inclined to show off their particularistic ties with Very Important People. Since national lawmakers are figures of power, this tendency among voters keeps Taiwanese legislators exceptionally busy attending private weddings, funerals, and banquets, often at the expense of attentiveness to national policy. The study concludes that guanxi culture brings constituency focus to the fore of Taiwan’s political representation, shedding some light on the ramification of political culture on democratic consolidation.

What is the relationship between internal development and integration into the global economy in developing countries? How and why do state–market relations differ? And do these differences matter in the post-cold war era of global conflict and cooperation? Drawing on research in China, India, and Russia and examining sectors from textiles to telecommunications, Micro-institutional Foundations of Capitalism introduces a new theory of sectoral pathways to globalization and development.

Literary imaginations about modern China are often synonymous with imaginations about “new people.” This talk focuses on how such imaginations unfolded and evolved in 20th-century Chinese science fiction. In particular, it calls attention to the dynamic interaction between translation and creation, and to the genre’s close engagement with ongoing ideological and literary debates within the national context. Jing Jiang is Associate Professor of Chinese and Humanities at Reed College. She teaches courses on Chinese language, literature, and culture. Aside from her book on twentieth century Chinese science fiction, she is also published in Asian Cinema, Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, Cultural Critique, and positions. She received the ACLS Pauline Yu Fellowship in 2020, and is currently working on a new book project tentatively titled &quot;The World Embedded in Modern Chinese Literary Imagination.&quot;

        The Great Exodusexamines one of the least understood forced migrations in modern East Asia—the human exodus from China to Taiwan following the Nationalist collapse and Chinese Communist victory in 1949. Peeling back layers of Cold War ideological constructs, the book tells a very different story from conventional historiographies the Chinese civil war, Chinese revolution, and Cold War Taiwan. Underscoring the displaced population’s trauma of living in exile and their poignant “homecomings” four decades later, Yang presents a multiple-event trajectory of repeated traumatization with the recurring search for home, belonging, and identity. By portraying the Chinese civil war exiles in Taiwan both as traumatized subjects of displacement and overbearing colonizers to the local peoples, this thought-provoking work challenges the established notions of trauma, memory production, diaspora, and reconciliation. It speaks to the importance of subject position, boundary-crossing empathic unsettlements, and ethical responsibility of researching, narrating, and representing historical trauma.

This talk examines citizen scoring in and public support for China’s Social Credit System (SCS). Dr. Fan analyzed the mechanism of credit scoring embedded in the SCS and show two facets of the SCS: a normative apparatus fostering “good” citizens and a regulative apparatus normalizing “deviant” behaviors. He also used a survey experiment to test how types of monitored behaviors and different information exposure explain public support for the SCS. The findings suggest that citizens are more likely to support monitoring financial behaviors. More importantly, exposure to Western media increases public support for monitoring non-financial behaviors in the SCS. Fan Liang (PhD, University of Michigan) is an Assistant Professor of Media at Duke Kunshan University. His research examines how new communication technologies construct social and political changes, and how social and political powers shape and regulate the design and operation of such technologies.

        People tend to think of decolonization in Asia as being a phenomenon of the Cold War Era, where European colonizers, having survived humiliating blows of Japanese occupation of their Asian colonies during the Second World War, reluctantly but unavoidably relinquished their suzerainty and allowed numerous new nation-states to emerge in the Asia-Pacific through the first three decades of the postwar period.

In reality, the South China Sea and its surrounding political entities have always been a realm of influence of a superpower external to the region; the British Empire during the Colonial Era and the US through much of the latter half of the 20thcentury. No sooner US influence started to recede with the conclusion of the Cold War, than South China Sea starts to experience the hegemonic encroachment of rising China. Taiwan feels the heat of increasing PRC pressure upon her precarious independent status in the global arena, while Hong Kong’s freedom once guaranteed by the Basic Law and the ‘1 country 2 systems’ principle has been continuously and methodically dismantled from the earliest years of Xi Jinping’s presidency. The democratizing trend of Southeast Asia has suffered similar setbacks, with Thailand and Myanmar reverting back to military rule and returning to draconian measures to suppress pro-democracy protesters.

The online pro-democracy network known as the ‘Milk Tea Alliance,’ which emerged in April 2020, among netizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, is the first online movement to vocalize what has been a long standing yet unspeakable suspicion among the younger generation of this region—that the Chinese Communist Government is a mutual obstacle for democratization of the Asia-Pacific. For the first time in history, the fight for Taiwan independence, Hong Kong’s freedom, and Thailand and Myanmar’s democratization becomes one and the same, united by the superpower threat against democracy and human rights in the form of PRC influence across the region. The ‘Milk Tea Alliance’ quest for freedom is the last of the unfinished business from the colonial era. It is the long overdue last wave of decolonization in Asia.

        Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia has increased dramatically since 2013 when the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was announced. The dominant investments have been in infrastructure development, power plant construction and mineral extraction and processing. In a recent collaboration with the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, the Research Center for Climate Change at the University of Indonesia (RCCC-UI) conducted a spatial environmental assessment of 14 clusters of BRI projects throughout Indonesia. The research project seeks to understand the environmental and social impacts of the projects by focusing on a project’s distance from primary forest, trends of vegetation and carbon loss, emission of nitrous oxide (NOx) as a dangerous air pollutant, the presence of selected endangered species and the presence of affected Indigenous Peoples.

Join us on Wednesday, April 20, for a discussion on the spatial environmental assessment of select BRI projects in Indonesia, featuring Rebecca Ray and University of Indonesia researchers Albertus Hadi Pramono, Masita Dwi Mandini Manessa, Mochamad Indrawan and Dwi Amalia Sari.

        China has become deeply integrated in the world economy, yet gradual marketization has facilitated the country’s rise without a wholesale assimilation to global neoliberalism. In her new book, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy: The Market Reform Debate,” Isabella Weber uncovers the fierce contest for economic reforms that shaped China’s path. In the first post-Mao decade, reformers were sharply divided: should China destroy the core of the socialist system through shock therapy, or should it use the institutions of the planned economy as market creators? With hindsight, the historical record proves the high stakes behind the question: China embarked on an economic expansion commonly described as unprecedented in scope and pace, whereas Russia’s economy collapsed under shock therapy.

Based on extensive research, including interviews with key Chinese and international participants and World Bank officials as well as insights gleaned from unpublished documents, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy” charts the debate that ultimately enabled China to follow a path to gradual reindustrialization. Beyond shedding light on the crossroads of the 1980s, it reveals the intellectual foundations of state-market relations in reform-era China through a longue durée lens. Overall, the book delivers an original perspective on China’s economic model and its continuing contestations from within and from without.

Join us on Thursday, April 21, for a discussion with Isabella Weber, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, on her new book and China’s path of economic reform. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global Economic Governance Book Talk Series.

The daughter of Chinese parents who came to the United States to secure the American dream for their children, Joan is intensely devoted to her work, happily solitary, successful. She does look up sometimes and wonder where her true roots lie: at the hospital, where her white coat makes her feel needed, or with her family, who try to shape her life by their own cultural and social expectations.

        Rapid coastal development presents substantial risks to marine habitats, biodiversity and coastal communities dependent upon vital marine ecosystem services. Noting that China is now the world’s largest bilateral creditor of overseas development finance, Blake Alexander Simmons, Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources at Colorado State University, will present a new study investigating the extent to which coastal development projects financed by Chinese development finance institutions present both direct and indirect risks to marine habitats, threatened species, marine protected areas and coastal Indigenous communities. Simmons will discuss where risks are greatest and how this knowledge can be used to create an agenda for “blue-ing” China’s overseas development finance portfolio.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
