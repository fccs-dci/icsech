        Abstract: The late 19th and early 20th century influx of Western influence in East Asia spurred a dual challenge for China and Japan. They faced pressure to implement Westernization reforms to confront Western encroachment, while simultaneously seeking explanations for perceived physical frailties of their populaces, especially regarding disease. In this context, certain afflictions gained profound symbolic importance as ‘national sicknesses’ - beriberi in early Meiji Japan, and tuberculosis in Republican China. This discourse examines the intertwined cultural and political attitudes surrounding these sicknesses, tracing how the ‘national sickness’ concept evolved across Chinese and Japanese contexts, analyzing its modern characteristics. It explores the progression of pathological explanations for beriberi and tuberculosis in East Asia and the West. It highlights the dynamic relationship between Chinese and Western medicine in Japan as Western practices were adopted. Furthermore, it delineates tuberculosis' transition in China from a ‘consumptive illness’ under traditional medicine to the Western-defined fatal disease‘tuberculosis’ of Western medicine. By investigating these ‘national sickness’ phenomena, the speaker aims to shed light on defining traits of modern East Asian science in the early 20th century. Elucidating the interplay of evolving medical epistemologies, cultural forces, and nationalism contributes nuanced understanding of East-West exchanges during this era of globalizing modernity.

        Between 1918 and 2023, spanning over a century, humanity has faced and conquered numerous infectious diseases. Among these, the three major global infectious diseases that stand out for their unique characteristics and lasting impact are the influenza pandemic, SARS, and COVID-19. The speaker will delve into these diseases from the perspective of Chinese medicine, a viewpoint often neglected by previous researchers, examining how traditional medicine defines and treats these ailments. COVID-19 has arguably made the most profound impact on the general public, and the speaker will highlight key publications that resonate with the pandemic’s history. Furthermore, in discussion with medical historians, the speaker will reassess the state of research and education in Chinese medical history pre- and post-pandemic. Emphasizing public history, a conversation will be initiated on educational practices and public discourse regarding the history of diseases. By simultaneously focusing on research and the dissemination of scientific knowledge, the aim is to enhance the understanding and impact of disease within the history of science.

        India goes to the polls for its national elections amidst widespread concerns that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has systematically eroded Indian democracy. Since coming to power in 2014, the Modi government has compromised the integrity and independence of state institutions, and attacked civil society actors, media, academia, and opposition parties. Yet the Indian case is not unique in an era of democratic decline, as elected leaders have tapped deeply felt resentments, harnessed new coalitions, and created popular narratives that legitimize the concentration of power in single parties and individuals. Through a comparative discussion of India, Turkey, and Eastern Europe, this panel will explore how to understand this authoritarian turn, varying modes of repressive governance within democracies and bases of its support, and the channels through which opposition parties and social movements navigate and resist a fraught political landscape.

The devastating movement unleashed by Mao in 1966, which claimed around two million lives and saw tens of millions hounded, shapes China to this day. Yet in a country where leaders have long seen history as a political tool, the Cultural Revolution is a particularly sensitive subject. How does the Chinese Communist Party control discussion of the topic? And how has an era which turned the nation upside down been used to maintain the political status quo?

        与今日中美关系的重要性截然相反，晚清时期的中美关系从未成为两国外交的重点，双方也严重缺乏交流，未能建立起对彼此社会和文化的深入认识，在中国一侧尤属不堪。美国建国并派遣商船来华之时，正逢清代乾隆年间，弱小的美国面对着的是清代中国这个大国施行已久的对外关系框架，必须遵循其典章制度。然而，两次鸦片战争以后，局面开始急剧反转。美国尾随英法之后，开始以殖民武力为背景，通过不平等条约和国际法，改变在华地位，并稳步拓展在华的商贸和外交网络。当时的清代中国，却完全无力对美达成对等交际，远者不能保护数十万赴美的华工，近者无力改变正在覆盖整个东亚、东南亚和中亚地区的新式国际政治和外交的格局，遂至内外交困、处处被动。如今，自诩天朝的大清国早已经灰飞烟灭，而美利坚却也早已超过英法等国而成为全球头号强国。那么，晚清时期的中美交往究竟是什么样的呢？双方的交往又能够告诉我们什么呢？本场讲座通过回顾中美交往初期的历史，来观察双边势力的演变、近代欧美对中国印象的变迁、欧美为中心的文明话语的再构建、欧美近代外交体系和国际法在中国和东亚世界的逐步建立，以及清代中国的衰亡。

        The Ordos Plateau, the semiarid loess-soil region of northern Shaanxi at the periphery of the East Asian summer monsoon, is a historically multiethnic domain that is sensitive to small shifts in climate. During imperial times, Ordos residents generally subsisted as herders, farmers, and salt miners. The Ordos was also a strategic zone of transit, transition and contention between the steppes and the imperial core. For that reason, it was often heavily fortified despite its unpredictable climate, its highly erodible soil, and its delicate ethnic geography. This talk presents research based on the spatial analysis of 564 data points representing the locations of cities and forts from pre-imperial times through the Qing dynasty, proxies for the intensiveness of human activity in any time and place, as recorded inTheAtlas of Chinese Material Culture(Zhongguo Wenwu dituji中国文物地图集). Each of those sites was also associated with land degradation, which in turn shaped subsequent possibilities in the region. Adopting the time scale of the entire imperial era, this research traces changes to imperial boundaries, political ecology, and state power in the context of both geopolitical and environmental histories. It also tracks the long history of conflict, coexistence, and settler colonialism in an originally multiethnic region. The paper narrates the southerly retreat of the state after the Han era as the region became more arid; the emergence of what eventually became the great wall line starting in the Tang; the militarization of that line in the Song followed by the formation of ethnically Han space along it during the in Ming; and the emergence of an even more southerly commercial and ethnically Chinese space in the Qing.

        The Hoover Project on China’s Global Sharp Power invites you to Hong Kong After the National Security Law on Tuesday, May 14 from 4-5:30pm PT.

This event will present perspectives on the current political and civic climate in Hong Kong since the passage of the National Security Law on June 30, 2020 and the imposition of Article 23 on March 23, 2024. How have these developments fit into the broader history of the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong? What has changed in Hong Kong’s once vibrant civil society? What is the latest on the trials of pro-democracy activists? How have diasporic advocates constructed a Hong Kong political identity in exile?

Four panelists—Ambassador James Cunningham, the Chairman of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong and former Consul General of the United States to Hong Kong and Macau (2005-2008); Sebastien Lai, a democracy advocate and son of jailed Hong Kong businessman and publisher Jimmy Lai; Sophie Richardson, the former China Director at Human Rights Watch; and Cherie Wong, the former leader of Alliance Canada Hong Kong (ACHK)—will discuss these issues and more in a conversation moderated by Hoover William L. Clayton Senior Fellow Larry Diamond.

        The UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome associate professor of ethnomusicology at Emory University, Meredith Schweig, to discuss her bookRenegade Rhymes: Rap Music, Narrative, and Knowledge in Taiwan(University of Chicago Press, 2022).

Online participants can join the book talk via Zoom here:https://washington.zoom.us/j/99721107676

Renegade Rhymesinvites readers into Taiwan’s vibrant underground hip-hop scene to explore the social, cultural, and political dynamics of life in a post-authoritarian democracy. Beginning in the immediate aftermath of martial law (1949-1987), the book follows Taiwan’s earliest rappers and DJs as they critiqued the island’s political system, spun tales from their perspectives as members of marginalized ethnic communities, and reimagined previously suppressed local musical forms. A series of ethnographic and historical chapters trace an arc between these earliest interventions and the innovations of present-day musicians, who grapple with ongoing existential uncertainty imposed by the island’s ambiguous geopolitical status and accelerating neoliberalization. The book argues that rap artists past and present configure post-authoritarianism as a creative political intervention, whose ultimate objective is the reordering of epistemic hierarchies, power structures, and gender relations.

Meredith Schweig completed her MA and PhD in ethnomusicology at Harvard University, where she also received her BA in Music and East Asian Studies. Schweig is the recipient of a 2023-2024 Scholar Grant from the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange. Previously, she was a Fulbright Senior Scholar in Taiwan (2020-2021), and a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Humanities and Hyperstudio Fellow at MIT (2013-2015). Her 2016 article “‘Young Soldiers, One Day We Will Change Taiwan’: Masculinity Politics in the Taiwan Rap Scene” was awarded both the Marcia Herndon Prize and the Jaap Kunst Prize from the Society for Ethnomusicology. Her 2014 article &quot;Hoklo Hip-Hop: Re-signifying Rap as Local Narrative Tradition in Taiwan” was awarded the Rulan Chao Pian Publication Prize from the Association for Chinese Music Research.

        BUSINESS HISTORY WITHOUT BUSINESS: MAKING SENSE OF CHINA’S PRE-1949 CATTLE TRADE

        China’s large and valuable pre-1949 cattle trade is effectively invisible to historians. Trade was completely decentralized, and transactions were often conducted clandestinely, leaving behind little record. Alongside the few discernible routes, cattle trade ran simultaneously in all directions corresponding to the changing value of animals over their lives.

Faced with the challenge of recreating the outlines of China’s cattle trade, this paper begins with a methodological question: how to conduct business history of an industry that had few major firms, no centralized accounts, and no clear geography of comparative productive advantage. Our method was to create a composite of over two hundred local snapshots taken from newspapers, ethnographic and government reports, and our own interviews of former trade intermediaries known asniufanzi. These two types of data complement each other, expanding our geographic scope to include large parts of the country that documentary evidence overlooks, and crucially, introducing the first-hand perspectives of the many different people involved in the trade, adding substance to what would otherwise simply be a parade of numbers. Together, these sources reveal China’s cattle trade to have been a network of overlapping systems, one that combined distance trade, specialized demand and the intensely local needs of seasonal markets.

        What defines the polarity of the current international system? Unipolarity, bipolarity, or multipolarity? This talk examines the theoretical and real-world challenges of deciphering the polarity of the international system. It argues that the root cause of the challenges lies with the fuzzy nature of power, which makes precise measurement of state power and comparisons of state power difficult at best. This is especially the case during a power transition, which creates fluid and unpredictable power trends. For example, whether a rising China has “peaked” or a relatively declining United States has successfully retrenched have implications for forecasting the emerging polarity. This talk examines the current debate over polarity and how it affects our understanding of US-China relations. It is premised on structural realism’s insight on the centrality of polarity in explaining great power behaviors and international outcomes.

        On Thursday, May 23 from 3:30 to 5pm in THO 317 and online,the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Henry Yeung (National University of Singapore) to discuss his book Interconnected Worlds: Global Electronics and Production Networks in East Asia. His book offers key empirical observations on the highly contested and politicized nature of semiconductor global production networks since the US-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic. In this capital-intensive manufacturing industry, governance and power dynamics are manifested differently from many other industries due to highly complex technology regimes, production network ecosystems, and, more recently, geopolitical imperatives. While some of these critical dynamics had been in play ahead of the 2020s in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, their intensity and significance became more apparent by the early 2020s. The book also examines the need for strategic partnerships with technology leaders toward building national and regional resilience in the US, Western Europe, and East Asia.

ProfessorHenry Yeunghas been a Distinguished Professor at the Department of Geography, National University of Singapore, since 2018, and Professor of Economic Geography since 2005. As a leading academic expert in global production networks and the global economy, his research interests cover broadly theories and the geography of transnational corporations, East Asian firms, and developmental states. He is the first geographer based in Asia to receive both the 2018 American Association of Geographers Distinguished Scholarship Honors (“in recognition of his extraordinary scholarship and leadership in the discipline”) and the UK’s Royal Geographical Society Murchison Award 2017 (for “pioneering publications in the field of globalisation”). In November 2022, he was conferred the 2022 Sir Peter Hall Award for Lifetime Contribution to the Field by the Regional Studies Association in London: “acknowledging and celebrating excellence in the field of regional studies”.

        Nalan Xingde or Nara Singde 納蘭性德 (1655-1685) is regarded as one of the greatest lyric (ci詞) poets of the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644-1912). In 1682, Xingde embarked on two separate journeys to Manchuria, first accompanying the Kangxi Emperor to make sacrifices at the tombs of the dynasty’s founding fathers; then, on a secret cartographic mission to survey Russian strategic points and roads leading to the city of Nerchinsk.

The focus of this presentation is on the poems Xingde wrote during his two trips to Manchuria with a particular emphasis on the concept of the “frontier”. As a member of the first generation of Manchus raised in Beijing, Manchuria is on the one hand, the land of Xingde’s ancestors, a region anointed by the Kangxi Emperor as the “mnemonic site of Manchu identity”. On the other hand, it is a vast and distant land with borders that Xingde was tasked with mapping. This paper investigates the depiction of Manchuria in Xingde’s poetry. It looks at how the poet draws from the well-established tradition of “frontier poetry” 塞外詩 while infusing his unique identity as a Manchu as well as his poetic sensibility into these poems written in Manchuria, and how this in turn, enriches our understanding of the “frontier”.

        CHINA’S VIRAL VILLAGES: DIGITAL NATIONALISM IN TIMES OF CRISIS

Crisis moments like the 2019 Hong Kong protests or the COVID-19 pandemic have shone a spotlight on how divided political opinions are across the Chinese-speaking world, often along fault lines created by tribalist and nationalist attitudes. These attitudes are shaped by official propaganda, but they also interact in complicated ways with the widespread adoption of internet technologies, and especially of mobile and interactive ‘web 2.0’ technologies since the start of the 21st century. Advances in ICT have augmented and accelerated human interactions, included group sentiments, ideologies, and political programmes. Community attachment is today adopted, filtered, transformed, enhanced, and accelerated through digital networks, whether in seemingly banal cases such as fandom practices or in more overtly political contexts such as nationalist agitation. As such processes unfold, the state’s techno-nationalist politics, the commercial rationale of platform providers, and the technical affordances of specific digital designs all conspire to drive viral interactions on China’s internet, be it on social media apps like Sina Weibo or video-sharing platforms like Bilibili. Based on observations about recent developments in the Chinese-speaking world, Florian Schneider relates his earlier analyses of Chinese online nationalism vis-à-vis Japan to the post-pandemic era, asking: what happens to nationalism when it goes digital?

        RACISM IN CHINA'S SPORTS FANDOM

        This talk discusses the manifestation of racism within China’s sports fandom, focusing on a case study of basketball fans’ discussions about the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement on Hupu, the leading Chinese-language sports fandom platform. The research reveals a pervasive trend of negative commentary towards the BLM movement on Hupu, which derives from China’s historical racial thinking and contemporary nationalist ideology. Hupu users’ expression of anti-Black sentiments reflects the nationalist underpinnings of China’s sports fandom and is dialectically connected to its “mainstream” geopolitical opinions. The research findings offer a fresh perspective on the perpetuation of Han chauvinism and racism within the Chinese-language social media sphere, shedding light on the intersections of sports culture, nationalism, and global sociopolitical movements.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

This program is a collaboration between theUS Heartland China AssociationandChina Institute in America.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
