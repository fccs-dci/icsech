        Taiwan, the United States, and the Hidden History of the Cold War in Asia: Divided Allies

Book Talk with Hsiao-ting Lin

Online Event

*﻿RSVP Requested

On Thursday, May 11, 2023, at 3:30p.m. PT, the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Hsiao-ting Lin to discuss his newly published monograph,Taiwan, the United States, and the Hidden History of the Cold War in Asia: Divided Allies. Lin's book explores the challenges which faced the United States and Taiwanese alliance during the Cold War, addressing a wide range of events and influences of the period between the 1950s and 1970s. Tackling seven main topics to outline the fluctuations of the U.S.–Taiwan relationship, this volume highlights the impact of the mainland counteroffensive, the offshore islands, Tibet, Taiwan’s secret operations in Asia, Taiwan’s Soviet and nuclear gambits, Chinese representation in the United Nations, and the Vietnam War. Utilizing multinational archival research, particularly the newly available materials from Taiwan and the United States, to reevaluate Taiwan’s foreign policy during the Cold War, revealing a pragmatic and opportunistic foreign policy disguised in nationalistic rhetoric.

Hsiao-ting Lin is a research fellow and curator of the Modern China and Taiwan collection at the Hoover Institution, for which he collects material on China and Taiwan, as well as China-related materials in other East Asian countries. He holds a BA in political science from National Taiwan University (1994) and an MA in international law and diplomacy from National Chengchi University in Taiwan (1997). He received his DPhil in oriental studies in 2003 from the University of Oxford. He has published extensively on modern Chinese and Taiwanese politics, history, and ethnic minorities, including Accidental State: Chiang Kai-shek, the United States, and the Making of Taiwan (2016); Modern China’s Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West (2011); and Tibet and Nationalist China’s Frontier: Intrigues and Ethnopolitics, 1928–49 (2006).

        A managed foreign exchange regime has been integral to the Chinese economy since 1949, but how did it come about? In this talk, I discuss its gradual formation from the Communist victory in 1948 – 49 to the first Canton Fair in 1957. While influenced by Soviet institutional models, the foreign exchange regime in early PRC era was built on an export- and remittance-oriented economy that only partially aligns with the new government’s geo-economic orientations. I trace the confluence of Yan’an-era and Nationalist techniques of reserve margin management on this era, and stress two previously under-discussed features — one, the impact of US-led embargo on official thinking on foreign exchange; and two, that we need to view and compare the Chinese experience as part of a global management of “hard” currency in the post-war era.

As US-China relations grow increasingly tense, Taiwan has found itself in the middle of a decoupling of the two largest economies in the world. Taiwan-based semiconductor firm TSMC has responded to the recent US CHIPS Act by building a new fabrication plant on US soil. Taiwan and the US are on the cusp of signing a major bilateral trade deal. Meanwhile, the global economy is still reeling from multiple years of supply chain disruptions from the COVID pandemic and its effects on inflation. How will these changes affect Taiwan’s businesses?

This conference invites experts from academia, think tanks, and industry to discuss Taiwan and US business trends. Three panels discussing the semiconductor industry, supply chains, and US-Taiwan trade will take place from Friday afternoon to Saturday morning. Ryan Hass, Chen-Fu and Cecilia Yen Koo Chair in Taiwan Studies at the Brookings Institution, will give the keynote address.

This event is hosted by the East Asia Center, the Foster Global Business Center, and the Taiwan Studies Program.

Registration is required to attend in person. Individuals without tickets will be denied entry at the door.

        2023年是“共建‘一带一路’倡议”发起十周年。十年来，倡议得到中国政府的力挺，得到众多国家的瞩目与热议，也引起不少国家的担心和猜疑。据中国外交部统计，十年来，“世界上超过3/4的国家和32个国际组织参与其中”，“拉动近万亿美元投资规模，形成3000多个合作项目，为沿线国家创造42万个工作岗位，让将近4000万人摆脱贫困”。由于众多一带一路项目是在欠发达和法制欠缺的国家，投资项目的政治、军事、安全、外汇和法律风险比较突出，纷争也再所难免。
本次讲座从国际仲裁的角度专注分析与归纳这些纷争实例。首先从“一带一路”本身定义的不确定性入手；继而对纠纷分门别类地进行举例说明和讨论，包括中国企业与当地政府的争议、中国企业与当地企业的争议、中国企业之间的争议，等等。最后，总结十年来的经验教训。

        Postwar Hong Kong experienced some of the fastest economic growth in the developing world. What has received less recognition, however, is that productivity was just as exceptional, outpaced only by Japan. Scholars have focused on the former phenomenon through comparative advantage and low-cost labor but overlooked the latter, thereby conflating growth with development. Drawing on state and firm archival records, this talk examines the period of Hong Kong’s industrial diversification in the 1970s and 1980s and offers an explanation of manufacturing development and efficiency, arguing that Hong Kong firms turned to Taiwan state-owned enterprises to acquire advanced equipment and know-how. The talk looks closely at Meyer Aluminum of Hong Kong and its long-term relationship with Taiwan state-owned industries. By shifting focus from the macro-level to the micro and examining the needs and strategies of firms, the talk challenges understandings of the developmental state and the dichotomy of state versus market. It illustrates how actors responded to different contexts and available opportunities rather than let themselves be guided by state economic designs.

Decades of economic reforms have made China one of the most unequal countries in the world, but the impact of this inequality is not just socioeconomic. Drawing on first-hand ethnographic research among rural migrant factory workers in the Pearl River Delta in southern China, Wanning Sun presents key findings from her latest bookLove Troubles: Inequality in China and its Intimate Consequences(Bloomsbury 2023). She discusses how big, structural issues of socioeconomic inequality shape the ways in which individuals from different socioeconomic groups understand, think about, and experience love and intimacy. She also explores how inequality—both socioeconomic and cultural—impacts on the intimate lives of the nation’s vast and growing population of rural migrant workers.

Wanning Sunis Professor of Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA). She is a member of the College of Experts, Australian Research Council (2020-2023). She is best known for her work in the fields of Chinese media and cultural studies, migration, and social change in contemporary China, and diasporic Chinese media. She is the author ofLeaving China: Media, Migration, and Transnational Imagination(Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield, 2002);Maid in China: Media, Morality, and the Cultural Politics of Boundaries(Routledge, 2009);Subaltern China: Rural Migrants, Media, and Cultural Practices (Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield, 2014), andLove Troubles: Inequality in China and its Intimate Consequences(Bloomsbury 2023).

        Intensifying US-China competition has put American colleges and universities–and specifically researchers, scientists, and scholars of Asian heritage–under a microscope. Against a backdrop of rising anti-Asian hate, recent efforts to protect US technology and research have resulted in pain and mistrust and infringed on civil rights and civil liberties.

In this event, leaders from Committee of 100, a non-profit organization of prominent Chinese Americans, and the Asian American Scholar Forumwill join Hoover fellows to consider what went wrong, and explore how to work together to advance international collaboration and uphold civil rights and civil liberties while safeguarding America’s leadership in research, science, and technology and its other vital national interests.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	Relationships with bureaucracies, commercial counterparts and civil society in host countries
	
	Communist party influence on organisational structure, style of operating and incentive and penalties for employees.
	
	How Chinese companies manage the complexities of operating in international environments including language, host country markets, unfamiliar political systems, and cultural milieus as well as with competition from other commercial entities.
	
	Case studies of particular Chinese companies operating abroad, or conversely, a range of Chinese companies operating in a particular host country.


The publishing outcomes of this conference will include a special issue proposal toThe China Journal.
