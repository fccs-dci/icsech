        国有企业不交利润和地租，少付利息，并拥有垄断权，却没有对劳动（含管理）收入的限制，看来很有吸引力。但由于这一巨大利益并不是确定地转让给某些个人，所以存在着对这一利益的争夺。尤其是对高管位置的争夺会带来94倍于民营企业的获罪率，因而看来有巨大利益的国企高管位置实际上风险很大，期望收益比直观的利益小得多，并不值得去争取。一旦这一国企幻象被戳穿，受过高等教育并有较长眼光的国企精英就有可能成为国企改革的动力。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道，收看讲座。

        Hong Kong has been the crucible of many hopes – of becoming Asia's leading international city; of maintaining uniquely, openness, personal freedoms and the rule of law within the People's Republic of China; of attracting China to change subtly, of providing a credible &quot;one country, two systems&quot; model that Taiwanese people would wish to follow.

Now, and especially since the introduction by Beijing of the all-encompassing National Security Law in mid-2020, all those hopes are dashed, and discourse is severely curtailed – with silence, exile or prison the grim alternatives facing the city's independently-spirited folk, although ideas of liberty and autonomy still live on within Hong Kong's myriad nooks and crannies.

In a new bookTwo Systems, Two Countries: A Nationalist Guide to Hong Kong(University of California Press, 2022), Monash University Senior Lecturer in Chinese Studies Kevin Carrico traces the origins of Hong Kong nationalism, and notes that ever fewer Hong Kong citizens now identify as &quot;Chinese.&quot; Seeking to understand this contradiction through years of research and conversations in Hong Kong, he traces the origins of HK nationalism, its diverse schools and proposals for the city's future, and its implications for relations with Beijing.

Kevin Carrico will launch his book in conversation with Louisa Lim, Senior Lecturer at Melbourne University's Centre for Advancing Journalism.

Lim, who co-hosts the award-winningLittle Red Podcast, grew up in Hong Kong. Her own book,Indelible City: Dispossession and Defiance in Hong Kong(Penguin Random House, 2022), interweaves personal narrative with that of the city's two colonisers, Britain and China, and injects the insightful story of famed street calligrapher the 'King of Kowloon.' Her previous book,The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited(Oxford University Press, 2014), explored the lives of people affected by the protests of 1989 in China.

AIIA Victoria invites you to an engaging discussion on a timely topic, to be introduced by Rowan Callick OBE FAIIA.

        China’s overseas economic activity is diversifying beyond official development finance from its two main policy banks, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China. Despite the array of various debt, equity and grant financing mechanisms China’s policy banks have at their disposal, separate multi-stakeholder funds have emerged that are increasing Chinese financing capacity for overseas development projects. Since the mid-2000s, Chinese public and private financing institutions have established specialized investment funds that primarily provide equity financing to sector and region-specific development projects. These 'Overseas Development Investment Funds' (ODIFs) are an increasingly mentioned feature of Chinese foreign direct investment and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) financing instruments. Drawing on forthcoming research, Oyintarelado (Tarela) Moses, Data Analyst and Database Manager for the Global China Initiative at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and Laura Gormley, Research Assistant to the Global China Initiative, will explore the unique features, financing capacity, policy implications and future potential of China’s ODIFs.

Join us on Tuesday, November 8, for a discussion on diversifying the BRI with China’s ODIFs. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        This book is an in-depth examination of the regulatory, entrepreneurial, and organizational factors contributing to the expansion and transformation of China’s supplemental education industry. Like many parents in the United States, parents in China, increasingly concerned with their children’s academic performance, are turning to for-profit tutoring businesses to help their children get ahead in school. China’s supplemental education industry is now the world’s largest and most vibrant for-profit education market, and we can see its influence on the US higher education system: more than 70% of Chinese students studying in American universities have taken test preparation classes for overseas standardized tests. This book examines how opportunistic organizations thrived in an ambiguous policy environment and how they catalyzed organizational and institutional changes in this industry.

A former insider in China’s Education Industry, UHM sociologist Le Lin shows how and why this industry evolved to become a for-profit one dominated by private, formal, nationally operating, and globally financed corporations, despite restrictions the Chinese state placed on the industry.

        The launch of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) initiative in South China is one of the most important national strategies adopted by the Chinese government in recent years. It brings both opportunities and challenges to the development of the cities in the GBA. Tax laws and fiscal policies have been employed by GBA governments to facilitate the promotion of various industries. In the GBA, there is no unified tax law scheme, as three different tax regimes are implemented in the GBA mainland area, Hong Kong and Macau respectively. This seminar will discuss tax harmonisation and competition within the GBA for both talents and investment. Hong Kong’s simple and low tax system is no longer its unique advantage in the GBA and Hong Kong needs to face reality and take action to improve its attractiveness.

        The trading voyages to the Pearl River delta made by British, American and European ships in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were the longest and most hazardous in the world. Some were circumnavigations of the globe in an era when large areas of the globe were still unknown to western explorers. This paper makes two arguments: first, that the international and multi-ethnic personal and businessnetworks formed by merchants were a means of mitigating the many risks of these long-distance ventures, and that non-western actors played a central role in this; second, that maritime insurance became a key risk-reducing device developed by thesenetworks to help grow this commerce in a period before the Opium Wars, when foreign trade with China remained restricted to Canton. This is the first work to examine how tradingnetworks and their insurance practices in Asia enabled the riskiest of trades to be managed successfully.

        If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that the world is bound together by shared challenges—and that at the center of those challenges stands China. Thanks to decades of breakneck growth and development, Chinese officials, businesses, and institutions now play a critical role in every major global issue, from climate change to biotechnology. China’s Next Act re-envisions China’s role in the world in terms of sustainability and technology. This reframing is essential both because none of these increasingly pressing, shared global challenges can be tackled without China, and because they are reshaping China’s economy and its foreign policy, with major implications for the world at large. At the same time, sustainability and technology issues present opportunities for intensified economic, geopolitical, and ideological competition—a reality that Beijing recognizes.

The danger is that China’s next act will drive divergence on the rules and standards the world desperately needs to tackle shared challenges in the decades ahead. In some areas, like clean technology development, competition can be good for the planet. But in others, it could be catastrophic: only cooperation can lower the risks of artificial intelligence and other disruptive new technologies.

The challenges posed by climate change, pandemics, and emerging technologies make dealing with China’s state, its firms, and other institutions more complex and more critical than ever before. China’s Next Act helps foreign countries, companies, and other organizations prepare for a future shaped by sustainability, technology—and a dramatic new chapter for China and the world.

        Part of the University of Chicago Center for East Asian Studies' East Asia by the Book! CEAS Author Talks series, this event will take place virtually on Zoom. Hear the author, Professor Haun Saussy, talk about his recent publication. Debates on the canon, multiculturalism, and world literature often take Eurocentrism as the target of their critique. But literature is a universe with many centers, and one of them is China. The Making of Barbarians offers an account of world literature in which China, as center, produces its own margins. This book investigates the meanings of literary translation, adaptation, and appropriation on the boundaries of China long before it came into sustained contact with the West. Professor Saussy focuses on the period before 1850, when the translation of foreign works into Chinese was rare because Chinese literary tradition overshadowed those around it. This publication looks closely at literary works that were translated into Chinese from foreign languages or resulted from contact with alien peoples. It explores why translation was such an undervalued practice in premodern China, and how this vast and prestigious culture dealt with those outside it before a new group of foreigners—Europeans—appeared on the horizon.

        Today American institutions dominate nearly every major ranking of global universities. Yet in historical terms, America’s preeminence is relatively new, and there is no reason to assume that U.S. schools will continue to lead the world a century from now. Indeed, America’s supremacy in higher education is under great stress, particularly at its public universities. At the same time Chinese universities are on the ascent. Thirty years ago, Chinese institutions were reopening after the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution; today they are some of the most innovative educational centers in the world. Will China threaten American primacy?

Empires of Ideas looks to the past two hundred years for answers, chronicling two revolutions in higher education: the birth of the research university and its integration with the liberal education model. William C. Kirbyexamines the successes of leading universities—The University of Berlin and the Free University of Berlin in Germany; Harvard, Duke, and the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States—to determine how they rose to prominence and what threats they currently face. Kirby draws illuminating comparisons to the trajectories of three Chinese contenders: Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, and the University of Hong Kong, which aim to be world-class institutions that can compete with the best the United States and Europe have to offer. But Chinese institutions also face obstacles. Kirby analyzes the challenges that Chinese academic leaders must confront: reinvesting in undergraduate teaching, developing new models of funding, and navigating a political system that may undermine a true commitment to free inquiry and academic excellence.

In this MCI webinar, Prof. Kirby will delve deeper into the key points of his acclaimed book and participate in a Q&amp;amp;A session subsequent to the talk.

        In May 1983, two Chinese engineers spent ten days visiting the decrepit Bolton Falls Dam on the Winooski River in upper Vermont. The visit likely raised eyebrows on both sides of the Pacific. Unlike most of their countrymen, who were sent abroad on study tours by their home institutions in China, these engineers were in Vermont at the invitation of the dam’s American owners, the Green Mountain Power Corporation. Having failed to obtain an affordable renovation plan from domestic consultants, Green Mountain had only done the logical thing and turned to the global leaders in small hydropower: China. In this talk, which draws upon ongoing research for a book on the history of small hydropower in China, Dr. Ghosh will first briefly trace China’s rise to a position of global leadership in small hydropower. Ghosh then will explore the activities of the Chinese-American engineer Alexander A.S. Tseng and the company he founded, Oriental Engineering &amp;amp; Supply Company (ORENCO). In 1972, Tseng was a member of the first delegation of Chinese-American scientists to visit the PRC. Recognizing China’s expertise and experience in small hydropower, Tseng set up ORENCO and brought that expertise to the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, helping build or restore nearly forty small dams across the country.

        Sometime during the 10th to 13th centuries CE a system of long-walls (or 'Great Walls') was built in areas currently in North China and Northeastern Mongolia. This network of walls, forts, and enclosures covers an estimated area of 4000 km and spans a wide range of ecozones, from the deserts of western China to the steppes of northern Mongolia and the Khingan mountain range. While this is one of the longest and most elaborate systems of its kind the world has ever seen, it is unclear who built it, when exactly it was built and for what purpose. Prof. Shelach-Lavi is heading a new research project, titledThe Wall(https://thewall.huji.ac.il/), which combines archaeological, geographic, historic and paleo-climatic data to date, map and analyze this extensive wall-system.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        GENDER DISCOURSE ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA: FROM PUA TUTORIAL TO DOUBAN FEMINISM

        Dr Bingchun Meng has written extensively about Chinese social media and its subjects. She provides a profound analysis of topics such as knowledge production, gender research and power structure, social science studies standpoints and academic awareness in different social contexts in China and the West. Her recent publication, The Politics of Chinese Media: Consensus and Contestation (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), offers an analytical account of the consensus and contestations of the politics of Chinese media at both institutional and discursive levels. It considers the formal politics of how the Chinese state manages political communication internally and externally in the post-socialist era, and examines the politics of news media, focusing particularly on how journalists navigate the competing demands of the state, the capital and the urban middle class readership. The book also addresses the politics of entertainment media, in terms of how power operates upon and within media culture, and the politics of digital networks, highlighting how the Internet has become the battlefield of ideological contestation while also shaping how political negotiations are conducted. Bearing in mind the contemporary relevance of China’s socialist revolution, this text challenges both the liberal universalist view that presupposes ‘the end of history’ and various versions of China exceptionalism, which downplay the impact of China’s integration into global capitalism.

        The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the public finances of African countries. It also led to rising debt levels in many African countries and has increased concerns about their ability to make their scheduled sovereign debt payments over the next few years. This looming debt crisis raises questions about how these countries can most effectively manage their debts and how their creditors can help them develop in sustainable and inclusive ways. Daniel Bradlow, SARCHI Professor of International Development Law and African Economic Relations at the University of Pretoria, and Magalie Masamba, Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria, will present key findings from the 2021 book, “COVID-19 and Sovereign Debt: The Case of SADC”, a multi-disciplinary publication focusing on the issue of African sovereign debt management and renegotiation/restructuring in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

Join us on Tuesday, December 13, for a discussion on COVID-19, sovereign debt and the case of the SADC region. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        THE HIGH COST OF CHINA'S DISENGAGEMENT (FEAT. GEORGE MAGNUS)

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnus is an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.
