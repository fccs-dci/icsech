        Standard narratives of the Chinese past present &quot;China&quot; as a continuous entity since ancient times, attaining its current territorial shape through cultural osmosis rather than military force, and presiding over a peaceful, hierarchical and Sinocentric system of Asian states maintained through Confucian deference. This vision has been promoted by Chinese governments, but it is also commonplace in survey courses, textbooks and popular culture produced outside of China, especially in the Anglophone world, and is even routinely referenced by politicians and diplomats from the US. It is also patently wrong, as anyone who has ever read any Chinese history knows: wars and conquest have been no less common in China and East Asia than anywhere else; modern migrations by Chinese into &quot;frontiers&quot; backed by state power have displaced indigenous peoples in ways reminiscent of European settler colonialism in the Americas, and the legacy of this expansion remains problematic decades after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in the territory of the former Qing empire. This lecture will examine how three key concepts in the historiography of China, &quot;Sinicization,&quot; the &quot;tribute system&quot; and &quot;Chinese dynasties,&quot; have ingrained and perpetuated an inaccurate exceptionalism in how we talk about the past and present of peoples and states in geographical China.

        On a hot summer day, Wang Guiping attended her divorce trial at the Xiqing People’s Tribunal. Taking an unfaithful spouse to court would, Guiping thought, help her end a hopeless relationship and actualize her lawful rights upon divorce. Later that day, Guiping would find herself betrayed not only by her husband, but by the court system and her own legal counsel. Taking this case as a point of departure, Ke Li recounts decades-long research on divorce litigation in rural China. Ultimately, this talk articulates a firm belief: divorce, seemingly prosaic, offers a unique window onto phenomena of great importance to sociologists, political scientists, sociolegal researchers, and China scholars.

        Many sources report the almost compulsive tendency of the Mongols to count themselves and the enemies they had just defeated and conquered. This constant numbering had to do with the famous decimal system, of which this lecture proposes a reassessment. The study aims to demonstrate that it was not only a military organization, but a system of general enregimentation of the subject population within nested military-administrative units allowing to ensure the ordering, the control and the mobilization of the subjects of the empire. Although it constituted the core of the Mongol imperial order and arguably reached its peak of sophistication at that time, this presentation will also show that it was certainly not an innovation within the political tradition of the Eurasian steppes.

        In this talk Dr. Xiaoxuan Wang will present preliminary ideas and findings from his ongoing project. This project explores the formation of European Chinese communities, focusing on people of southern Zhejiang origin, who make up the lion’s share of Chinese in continental Europe today. The project asks: If the construction of southern Zhejiang European communities underline efforts to construct a transnational life beyond the nation-state, what role did the Chinese state, especially the Republican and PRC governments, play in the transnationalism of southern Zhejiang people? The experience of European Chinese, especially its history, has been far less explored and understood than that of Chinese in Southeast Asia or America. The project hopes to provide a unique perspective on the intricate relations between transnationalism, localism and the state that have made and continue to make the Chinese overseas in the modern day.

China’s vision for international order is a matter of great global interest. This book analyses China’s efforts to realize this vision in its immediate neighborhood. Using a wide variety of sources, the book provides a historically informed account by examining the legacies of China’s imperial past and traditional political philosophy, discussing how those legacies have continued to inform the country’s foreign policy in the very different context of the modern society of sovereign nation-states. It argues that China today sees the maintenance of order as its own responsibility and that it believes this order needs to attribute different roles to ‘small’ and ‘big’ states to ensure stability. Furthermore, the book explores the different tools China employs to achieve its vision, including a proactive diplomacy, the control of international discourse, threat of punishment for ‘misbehavior’, and the promise of economic benefits in return for compliance.

        Economic history requires the use of numbers and units. Nevertheless, numbers and units themselves as recorded in Chinese historical sources could be problematic, due to misprints and copyists’ errors, variations in weights and measures, different institutional settings, as well as others. A universal solution in theory is very likely to be improbable if not impossible. This talk, studying grain prices in the Mongol Yuan dynasty, roughly from 1260 to 1350, intends to approach these challenges in a pragmatic and practical way. By contextualizing price numbers in multiple dimensions, I hope that the degree of consistency among numbers could be at least partially clarified, and that relatively more acceptable data series could be built. This talk will first give a brief introduction to the primary sources, then devote length to discussions on three key common issues: (1) institutional settings of original numbers, (2) official and local units of capacity, and (3) types and varieties of grain. After that, an overall presentation of price data will be given with some supplementary remarks. In conclusion, I will briefly outline some implications of the newly developed data series for further studies.

S﻿peaker's Bio:

Li Chunyuan is an Associate Professor at the Department of History, Xiamen University, China, and currently a Harvard-Yenching visiting scholar at Harvard University. He received his Bachelor degree in Economics in 2006 from Fudan University, China, then received his Doctoral Degree in History in 2014 also from Fudan University. Since 2013, he has been a visiting fellow or a visiting scholar at Tübingen University in Germany, The Academy of Korean Studies in South Korea, and Hongkong University of Science and Technology.

His research focuses on the historical transition of China from 1150 to 1450 with an emphasis on the Mongol-Yuan era, addressing questions of two dimensions: 1) how nomadic and sedentary cultures interacted with and adapted to each other in the Yuan period; and 2) how the Mongol Yuan period had reshaped Chinese traditions since Song-Liao-Jin and therefore laid a new foundation for later dynasties.

So far, he has published more than thirty journal articles. They concern mainly two areas. One is the economic situation under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, such as fiscal practices, salt monopolies, and market economies. He published a series of articles on prices under the Yuan dynasty, including land price, grain price, salt price, as well as interest rates. The other area of concern is the political dynamics in Yuan China, such as the transition of the Koryǒ-Mongol relations around 1260, the perception of the Chinese dynastic title Da Yuan among various cultural groups.

Currently, he is working on a framework for interpreting the extant scant primary sources on grain prices in Yuan China, trying to make use of those unsystematic, randomly recorded numbers and to piece together some useful data series.

        Abstract

Dr. Joseph Needham, a British biochemist, was dispatched by the British government to visit China during the Anti-Japanese War period and founded the &quot;Sino-British Scientific Cooperation Bureau&quot; in Chongqing. During this endeavor, he became very interested in the question of why modern science did not happen in China, and determined to seek the answers to it. In 1948, Dr. Needham began to write the book &quot;Science and Civilization in China&quot; in Cambridge, England. From then on, he completely turned to the research and writing of the history of science and technology in ancient China, which remained unchanged until his death in 1995. &quot;Science and Civilization in China&quot; has become one of the academic works with most profound and far-reaching influence in the 20th century. It not only reveals China's great contribution to the development of human civilization in history, but also shows the various connections and differences among the developments of civilizations in the East and the West. The intellectual heritage left by Joseph Needham is extremely rich, unique and inspirational. In recent years, many scholars have re-examined it from multiple perspectives, revealing its deep relevance to contemporary scholarship. This lecture consists of three parts: first, a brief introduction of Joseph Needham and his monumental treatise &quot;Science and Civilization in China&quot;, followed by a review of recent academic research results on the topic of &quot;A Second Look at Joseph Needham&quot;, and finally a discussion of Needham's intellectual heritage and its value and significance in the contemporary world.

        In this timely and illuminating talk, Dr Bates Gill will discuss the principal themes of his new book,Daring to Struggle: China's Global Ambitions under Xi Jinping(Oxford University Press, 2022). Drawing from the book's findings, Dr Gill will explain the fundamental motivations driving China's more dynamic, assertive and risk-taking approach to the world under Xi Jinping. InDaring to Struggle, Gill focuses on six increasingly important interests for today's China — legitimacy, sovereignty, wealth, power, leadership, and ideas — and details how the determined pursuit of these goals at home and abroad profoundly shapes its foreign relationships, for better and for worse. The result is a more contested strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

			Celia Langford, MA candidate in Asian Studies. “Breathing with the Page: Poetry, Painting, and the Subjective Role of the Viewer in Song Dynasty Literati Art.” In Northern Song Dynasty China, the influential poet and painter Su Shi (1037-1101) initiated a groundbreaking shift in perceptions on art, suggesting that poems and paintings were in essence the same thing; what one could do, so could the other. Scholars in the millennium since, including scholars of today, have long debated the nature of this complementarity. While many have focused on similarities in iconography, I will demonstrate here how parallels in the subjective and sensory experiences of the viewer are equally essential to Su Shi's poem-painting connection.

			
			
		
		
			
			Michael Dufresne, PhD candidate in Philosophy. “The Worlds of Wang Guowei: A Philosophical Case Study of Coloniality.” The Qing dynasty scholar Wang Guowei (1877–1927) has received little recognition in the philosophical community. Raised to be a scholar official, he gave up this path to pursue the study of Western philosophy, becoming particularly enamored with the works of Kant, Schiller, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. When the Qing dynasty fell in 1911, Wang denounced all his previous research interests and dedicated himself to traditional scholarship, fearing for the future of China’s traditions and cultures. My research into Wang Guowei functions as an exercise in decolonial philosophy, highlighting the impacts of coloniality on his thinking while attempting to revitalize his theories in view of decoloniality.

			
			
		
		
			
			Bobby McCullough, PhD candidate in Philosophy. “The Moral Status of Ends and Means in theHan Feizi.” The most common interpretation of political thought in theHan Feiziis that it advocates for immoral or amoral political practices for the sake of consolidating power in the hands of the monarch. I aim to offer a new interpretation of the text that considers separately the moral components of political ends and means and I argue that moral considerations are at the heart of Han Feizi's political project. My interpretation more seriously considers the axiological underpinnings of Han Feizi's political thought and allows us additional insight into the motivations behind thefajiaschool of thought in Warring States China.

        COAL CONSUMPTION IN CHINA: A REVIEW OF PLANS FOR DECARBONISATION AND AN OUTLOOK ON IMPORT DEMAND

        China’s consumption of coal has made headlines in the media over the past few years for several reasons. Its covid-stimulus spending was largely directed towards smokestack industries, pushing emissions up. Xi Jinping quite unexpectedly announced China had set itself a net-zero emissions target by 2026, with emissions peaking before 2030. Political tensions led to China imposing an embargo on imports of Australian coal. And in two consecutive years, parts of China suffered power supply shortages. This seminar will present analysis done using the Installation-level China Coal Model, one of the world’s most granular models of China’s coal sector. This will be focused on developments in domestic demand, production, and transport infrastructure for coal, and the resulting effects on Chinese demand for imported coal. These results will be connected with news on the covid-stimulus, net-zero target, the embargo, and power generation crises, and given context with a review of key policies for decarbonisation.

Jorrit Gosensreceived his PhD in Environmental Economics &amp;amp; Management from the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. His work has focused on the development of renewable energy technologies and industries, including the policies that drive these developments. A big focus in this work has been the renewable energy industries, or understanding why some countries manage to develop strong R&amp;amp;D or industrial capabilities, and whether this depends on country characteristics, technology characteristics, or policy design. In his current position at the Crawford School of Public Policy, Jorrit works on energy transitions more generally. Here he has led the development of one of the world’s most granular transport models of China’s coal sector, which is currently being expanded to cover the Asia-Pacific region, and the iron and steel sector. Jorrit created and runs China Energy Portal, an online resource with translated Chinese energy policy and statistics.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        Reporting on China is one of the most difficult jobs in journalism and one of the most important. American media coverage of China has profoundly influenced US government policy and shaped public opinion in the US and around the world. Mike Chinoy, a former CNN Beijing bureau chief, will talk about his new book, Assignment China, an oral history of American journalists who reported on China from the Communist revolution of 1949through the COVID-19 pandemic.

        The Lower Sesan 2 Dam (LS2) is the largest and most controversial hydropower dam ever developed in Cambodia. The 400 MW capacity project, which blocks both the Sesan and Srepok Rivers in Stung Treng Province, northeastern Cambodia, was only completed by a Chinese company, Hydrolancang International Energy Company, in 2018, as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Here, I consider the relationship between LS2 and sacred spaces of rural ethnic Lao people, including how spirit mediums and the associated belief systems of local people have been impacted by LS2. Female spirit mediums have contested the LS2 since before its construction began, and have also been directly affected by the dam. Adopting a feminist political approach, the argument is that apart from having potentially important material impacts, dams such as LS2 also serve to alter nature-society relations through variously affecting spirit mediums, their practices, and beliefs associated with spirits.

        Abstract

After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, leaders in China and the United States had high hopes of a lasting partnership between the two countries. More than 120,000 U.S. servicemen deployed to China, where Chiang Kai-shek's government carried out massive programs to provide them with housing, food, and interpreters. But, as Zach Fredman uncovers in The Tormented Alliance, a military alliance with the United States means a military occupation by the United States. The first book to draw on archives from all of the areas in China where U.S. forces deployed during the 1940s, it examines the formation, evolution, and undoing of the alliance between the United States and the Republic of China during World War II and the Chinese Civil War.

        China now boasts the world’s largest distant water fishing fleet, the third largest commercial shipping fleet by deadweight tonnage, advanced technology for exploring the deep sea, and its own global satellite system. It is about to complete its fifth research station in Antarctica. All this makes China a major actor in determining the future of the high seas – waters outside of national jurisdiction. Professor Liu Nengye of Singapore Management University will explain China’s views on high seas governance, starting with its stance during negotiations for the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the more recent treaty on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction. Professor Liu believes that achieving sustainability is an essential pillar of China’s approach to high seas governance.

        Reporting on China has long been one of the most challenging and crucial of journalistic assignments. Foreign correspondents have confronted war, revolution, isolation, internal upheaval, and onerous government restrictions as well as barriers of language, culture, and politics. Nonetheless, American media coverage of China has profoundly influenced U.S. government policy and shaped public opinion not only domestically but also, given the clout and reach of U.S. news organizations, around the world.

This book tells the story of how American journalists have covered China—from the civil war of the 1940s through the COVID-19 pandemic—in their own words. Mike Chinoy assembles a remarkable collection of personal accounts from eminent journalists, including Stanley Karnow, Seymour Topping, Barbara Walters, Dan Rather, Melinda Liu, Nicholas Kristof, Joseph Kahn, Evan Osnos, David Barboza, Amy Qin, and Megha Rajagopalan, among dozens of others. They share behind-the-scenes stories of reporting on historic moments such as Richard Nixon’s groundbreaking visit in 1972, China’s opening up to the outside world and its emergence as a global superpower, and the crackdowns in Tiananmen Square and Xinjiang. Journalists detail the challenges of covering a complex and secretive society and offer insight into eight decades of tumultuous political, economic, and social change.

At a time of crisis in Sino-American relations, understanding the people who have covered China for the American media and how they have done so is crucial to understanding the news. Through the personal accounts of multiple generations of China correspondents, Assignment China provides that understanding.

Guests can purchase the book fromColumbia University Press. Copies will be sold by the George Washington University Bookstore at the event.

Registration is free and open to the public.

This event will be recorded and will be available on the Sigur Center YouTube channel after the event.

        What would development look like if its practitioners and scholars were ‘against NGOs,’ challenging common sense about them? This book presents a critical perspective on NGOs, describing how they emerged as key agents of development over time. Through an interpretative history based on Gramscian concepts it shows how civil society organizations were gradually enlisted in development as non-state technocratic actors. The book argues that management studies and development studies emerged as commonsensical explanations for capitalist crises. Each offered complementary solutions to balance the needs of capital and society, in particular historical circumstances. These solutions also situated civil society as agents of development and vectors of management. Against NGOs fills a gap within the literature of management and development studies through its original discussion of their historical interconnections and shared themes. The book raises provocative questions on what forms of knowledge-politics can respond productively to the crises of our contemporary moment.

        IR scholars often define prestige as “reputation for power” and argue for its significance in the context of high-stakes negotiations, the dynamics of power transition, or (bi-polar) competition to attract allies and partners. Famously, Giplin argued that for international relations prestige is “enormously important” – even more so than power itself. This is because “if your strength is recognized, you can generally achieve your aims without having to use it.” But whereas Giplin and others correctly conceptualize the power of prestige in driving desired outcomes, there is yet little attention to what exactly it means for strength to be “recognized,” and who is doing the recognizing.

Drawing on the “visual turn” in IR and starting from the original (visual) connotation of prestige as “dazzling influence” and “glamour,” this talk interrogates the links between prestige and recognition from the vantage point of the politics of aesthetics. For the purpose, I turn to select cases linked to China’s bid for international prestige, especially based on the invocation of common (Silk Road) past and shared future. I show how, in different communities, visual representations and public displays disrupt standard formulations of a shared (Silk Road) past and also bring forth alternative understandings of the meaning and work of prestige. These cases, I suggest, can help clarify not only the important links between power and recognition, but can also showcase the need for critical exploration of prestige in relation to empire and ontologies of power, the complexities of post-colonial order, and the evolving spaces for political agency.

        The growing economic and political relationships between China and the African continent in the past two decades are well documented in social science and policy studies. As Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt-and-Road initiative continues to expand China’ global reach, pushback has resulted from the spread of Covid-19 and African governments’ increasing debt to the Chinese government. These developments raise new geopolitical questions now that other parts of the world and China are “decoupling.” State actors continue to occupy analytical mindsets.

Siu complicates the land-based, state-centered conceptual frameworks by highlighting the historical legacies and contemporary fluidities that make up the life worlds of multi-ethnic stakeholders who have long traversed the continental divides. Based on ethnographic trips in Tanzania, the Gulf Region, South and Southeast Asia, Guangdong and Hong Kong, Siu uncovers crucial layers of maritime connections and explores how diverse human encounters, their nuanced cultural meanings and intense powerplay are expressed.

        Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s



Book Talk with Chien-Wen Kung (National University of Singapore) 



O﻿nline Event 



*﻿RSVP requested

The UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Chien-Wen Kung to discuss his newly published monograph, Diasporic Cold Warriors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Philippine Chinese were Southeast Asia and possibly the world’s most exemplary overseas Chinese Cold Warriors. Fears of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Southeast Asia’s Chinese as conduits for PRC influence gripped states and societies then – as indeed they do today. Yet, ironically, the example of the Philippines shows that the &quot;China&quot; which intervened the most extensively in any Southeast Asian country during the Cold War was not the PRC. It was, rather, the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. Drawing upon archival research and fieldwork in Taiwan, the Philippines, the United States, and China, Diasporic Cold Warriors tells for the first time this story of the Philippine Chinese as anticommunist partisans by tracing their evolving relationship with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Philippine state over the middle third of the 20th century.

Chien-Wen Kung is an Assistant Professor of History at the National University of Singapore and the author of Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s. His scholarship has also been published in Modern Asian Studies, the International History Review, and Asian Ethnicity. Born and raised in Singapore, he received his B.A. in History and English from Dartmouth College and Ph.D. in Modern Chinese and International and Global History from Columbia University. With funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and National Heritage Board in Singapore, he is currently working on a cultural history of Singapore-China-Taiwan relations in the 1970s and 1980s.

        In this talk, Silvia Lindtner,Associate Professor in the School ofInformation andPenny W Stamps School of Art and Design at the Univesrity of Michiganwill draw from ethnographic research she has conducted over the last 14 months across two sites in China: 1) small-scale businesses that center on alternative food and spiritual practices via life in nature and the countryside and 2) large-scale, data-driven agricultural experiments at the outskirts of major urban centers. Prof. Lindtner will discuss how these two sites interact for the implementation of two recent state policies on “rural revitalization” and “national strengthening.” These policies are aimed at reinvesting into China’s “hinterlands:” from rural farmland to people’s most inner selves. They position data-driven techniques of automation, surveillance technology, and smart systems as key to the state’s ability to manage life that has partially escaped the state’s reach. And they call upon China’s youths who have turned away from the city to live and work in China’s countryside to co-produce what she calls “data engines,” i.e. a participatory form of techno-governance driven by an engineering mindset that aims to cultivate citizens as productive selves who operate on behalf of the party state and its ambition to build a “strong China” by turning inwards—China’s history, soil, and agriculture. Data engines, she shows, simultaneously enable, and slow down the automation of China’s soil and soul.

        TRULY HUMAN: INDIGENEITY AND INDIGENOUS RESURGENCE ON FORMOSA - BOOK TALK WITH SCOTT SIMON

        The Sediq and Truku Indigenous peoples on the mountainous island of Formosa – today called Taiwan – say that their ancestors emerged in the beginning of time from Pusu Qhuni, a tree-covered boulder in the highlands. Living in the mountain forests, they observed the sacred law of Gaya, seeking equilibrium with other humans, the spirits, animals, and plants. They developed a politics in which each community preserved its autonomy and sharing was valued more highly than personal accumulation of goods or power. These lifeworlds were shattered by colonialism, capitalist development, and cultural imperialism in the twentieth century.

Based on two decades of ethnographic field research, Truly Human portrays these peoples’ lifeworlds, teachings, political struggles for recognition, and relations with non-human animals. Taking seriously their ontological claims that Gaya offers moral guidance to all humans, Scott E. Simon reflects on what this particular form of Indigenous resurgence reveals about human rights, sovereignty, and the good of all kind.

Scott Simon (University of Ottawa), is a socio-anthropologist trained in both disciplines (anthropology and sociology). Co-holder of the Chair of Taiwan Studies at the University of Ottawa, he has lived in Taiwan for ten years and returns annually for field research. His research interests include Indigenous rights, development, the contribution of Taiwan to the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan’s international status, and Canada-Taiwan relations. He has written four books and numerous articles about Taiwan. He does policy-oriented research as member of the Centre for International Policy Studies and the Human Rights Research and Education Centre at the University of Ottawa, and as Senior Fellow at Ottawa’s Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

        CHINESE NATIONALISM AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEAS DISPUTES: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES

        Dr Andrew Chubb of Lancaster University will be joining us to discuss the causes and consequences of South China Sea nationalism.

In this talk, Dr Chubb will expand on research which traces the rise of Chinese popular nationalist attitudes and actions towards the South China Sea disputes. Extensive literature on nationalism in contemporary China has generally concentrated on its manifestations in relation to Japan, the United States, or the “West” in general. While this is understandable given the prominence of former imperialist powers as foils for China’s contemporary state-sanctioned national identity, it has left a dearth of accounts of Chinese nationalism in relation to its Southeast Asian neighbors. This talk will analyse original 2013 survey data on urban residents’ perceptions of the South China Sea dispute, internet search activity data stretching back to 2006, and quasi-ethnographic observation of online discourse. The analysis shows, first, that Beijing’s more confrontational policy in the South China Sea was a key cause of intensified Chinese public sentiments on the issue. This largely unintended effect generated significant new challenges to the party-state’s control of public opinion. The case shows how the Internet reduced the CCP propaganda state’s ability to frame domestic interpretations of foreign policy developments, but retains decisive agenda-setting influence over the issue’s salience. These findings provide theoretical insight into the causes of nationalism and the socio-political consequences of network technology under authoritarian regimes.

        THE KING’S ROAD: DIPLOMACY AND THE REMAKING OF THE SILK ROAD

        XIN WEN IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES AND HISTORY AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. HE IS A HISTORIAN OF MEDIEVAL CHINA, CENTRAL ASIA, AND EURASIA. HIS FIRST BOOK IS THE KING’S ROAD: DIPLOMACY AND THE REMAKING OF THE SILK ROAD (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2022).

        The King’s Road offers a new interpretation of the history of the Silk Road, emphasizing its importance as a diplomatic route, rather than a commercial one. Tracing the arduous journeys of diplomatic envoys, Xin Wen presents a rich social history of long-distance travel that played out in deserts, post stations, palaces, and polo fields. The book tells the story of the everyday lives of diplomatic travelers on the Silk Road—what they ate and drank, the gifts they carried, and the animals that accompanied them—and how they navigated a complex web of geographic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. It also describes the risks and dangers envoys faced along the way—from financial catastrophe to robbery and murder. Using documents unearthed from the famous Dunhuang “library cave” in Western China, The King’s Road paints a detailed picture of the intricate network of trans-Eurasian transportation and communication routes that was established between 850 and 1000 CE.

By exploring the motivations of the kings who dispatched envoys along the Silk Road and describing the transformative social and economic effects of their journeys, the book reveals the inner workings of an interstate network distinct from the Sino-centric “tributary” system. In shifting the narrative of the Silk Road from the transport of commodities to the exchange of diplomatic gifts and personnel, The King’s Road puts the history of Eastern Eurasia in a new light.

        Prof Christopher Rea will join us in-person to discuss the intersection of Chinese cinema &amp;amp; digital humanities. Book you free ticket now!

How can we use digital platforms—including social media—to enhance research and learning on modern China? How can we make the “obscure” (to non-specialists) discoverable? What are the expected and unexpected results of making an audiovisual archive public, as measured by views, comments, likes, or GoogleAnalytics data? And what happens when your book project morphs into a multi-platform digital extravaganza?

This presentation will share discoveries from the first few years of the Chinese Film Classics Project (chinesefilmclassics.org), an ongoing international effort to make early Chinese cinema history more accessible to the English-speaking world. Christopher Rea will speak about his experiences building an online course while writing his book Chinese Film Classics, 1922-1949 (2021), and how he worked with collaborators to create a free digital archive of early Chinese films with English translations. He will illustrate the talk with examples of “playlist pedagogy,” including curatorial techniques that highlight significant features of Chinese films, from songs to scenes to special effects. The presentation will also showcase sights and scenes from Chinese films of the “pre-Code,” WWII, and Civil War eras.

About the Speaker

        As China opened up its economy over the past four decades, conventional wisdom held that the country’s growing embrace of free markets would lead to a more liberal society. Instead, China’s unprecedented economic growth has positioned state capitalism as a durable foil to the orthodoxy of free markets, to the confusion of many in the West. Xi Jinping was recently appointed to a third five-year term as China’s supreme leader, and has increasingly doubled down on state control of the economy and many have commented on his renewed embrace of Maoist principles. What does this mean for the future of the Chinese economy and relations with the West? What are the implications of China returning to some of the ideological principles spearheaded by Mao Zedong? And how much of China’s decades of economic success can be credited to Mao and Maoism?

Christopher Marquis will discuss his new book, Mao and Markets (Yale University Press, 2023) which examines these questions and charts how Mao’s ideological principles, mass campaigns, and socialist institutions have enduringly influenced Chinese entrepreneurs, listed companies and provincial and city politicians.

        In this talk, India China Institute’s Postdoctoral Fellow Sarandha Jain will discuss her PhD dissertation, which studies the oil-mediated relationship between the Indian state and citizens. Focusing on both oil production and consumption, presenting ethnography of oil refineries, research institutes, state offices, a peri-urban working-class-neighborhood near Delhi, and ‘black markets’, her talk examines oil as an infrastructure for the state and for society. She argues that the Indian state distributes itself into citizens’ lives via petroleum products, which obtain their sociopolitical agencies while being produced in certain ways, and play out those agencies while being consumed in certain ways. Her ethnography of refineries details out the microprocesses of oil refining and the complex relationship that human and nonhuman actors share. It elaborates on how politics get programmed into petroleum products, designed to discipline consumer-citizens into particular lifestyles, and how varying actors encumber this. Research on oil consumption with ‘black-marketeers’ and ordinary consumers of petroleum products, probes “distorted discipline”, where governmental plans get mangled by the informal practices of state actors as well as citizens. How does the politics programmed into petroleum products in refineries actually play out once other actors intervene, and snatch control over oil away from the state? Investigating this tussle between legalized and illegalized groups, she describes how it structures citizens’ lives, and the constellations of power and forms of sociality it gives rise to. This talk highlights the constant churning between the state and citizens through ever-evolving devices of government, as well as through escape from them. Specific modes of subjectification, engineered through flows of oil, lie at the heart of this churning, over which state-citizen formations are negotiated.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
