Brief introduction:

Selecting a variety of works authored by both genders, this exhibition displays sample narratives that allow viewers to catch a glimpse of the joy, challenges, and frustration shared by elders in the past. While numerous texts demonstrate the elderly adults’ complaints about their physical decline, psychological uneasiness, and mental discomfort, positive writings that reflect the authors’ pleasure in and gratitude for getting old are also available in large quantity. Over three hundred keywords representing happy, sad, or the mixed feelings and complicated moods of the Qing elderly are highlighted in the exhibition.Besides, pictures visualizing old age and featuring past techniques to reassured aged persons are also displayed. The on-site book exhibition invites viewers to brainstorm situating the elderly in history and the significance of “age” as a category of historical analysis.

        INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON &quot;CHINA: FISCAL POLICIES FOR THE NEW ERA&quot;

        Over the past decade, China has unveiled an ambitious social and economic agenda for the New Era until 2050. China aims to become a “great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful by the middle of the century.” In getting there, China seeks more productivity driven growth that is more equally distributed, and one that relies less on foreign demand and technology. China also aims to build an “ecological civilization” spearheaded by the net zero carbon by the 2060 pledge of President Xi Jinping.

The implications for China’s fiscal policy are huge. Since the major fiscal reforms in 1994, which led to a recovery in the tax to GDP ratio and the central government’s share in it, China’s fiscal system has not undergone any fundamental changes. At the same time, the structure of the economy, the nature of fiscal policy, the structure of spending, and the level of government at which spending takes place have changed radically since the mid-1990s. Much more change lies ahead: China’s increasingly middle-class and aging society will rapidly increase public spending on health care and pensions. The recent economic challenges triggered by COVID have also revealed the need to expand coverage of China’s social safety net, in particular for migrant workers.

The goal of achieving a more just income distribution will require more investment in public services especially in rural areas. It will also require a fundamental shift in the tax system, which is regressive because of the large share in revenues derived from Value Added Tax and the limited role played by the personal income tax. Meanwhile, the large and growing mismatch between local government expenditure responsibilities and revenue capacity is increasingly undermining the effectiveness of fiscal policies, and will require a major revamp of intergovernmental fiscal relations to resolve. Furthermore, the overreliance on land revenues for infrastructure finance has become a critical issue with the dimming prospects for property development, and sustainable alternative sources of finance will need to be developed.

Against this background, we have chosen “China: Fiscal Policies for the New Era” as the topic for the East Asian Institute’s annual conference. The conference will comprise of keynote speeches, academic sessions and policy panels, and is open to academics, PhD students and policy makers.

        Capital punishment has occupied a unique position in Chinese legal history. As a permanent fixture in imperial China’s legal system, capital punishment was the sole corporal punishment consistently employed by various dynasties from Pre-Qin to the late Qing. From legislation to judicial practices, the use of ultimate punishment in Chinese history has been riddled with contradictions and complexities. This research addresses these dilemmas by placing an analytical spotlight on the functionality, rather than merely the mechanisms of state-endorsed killing. It chronicles the origins and evolution of capital punishment in pre-modern China by examining continuity and changes, execution methods and rituals, and how capital punishment was understood and experienced in history.

        OnThursday, January 19, 2023 from 3:30 to 5:00p.m. PT, Professor Seiji Shirane will join theUW Taiwan Studies Program to discuss his newly published monograph,Imperial Gateway: Colonial Taiwan and Japan’s Expansion in South China and Southeast Asia, 1895-1945.

Shirane’s book explores the political, social, and economic significance of colonial Taiwan in the southern expansion of Japan’s empire from 1895 to the end of World War II. Challenging understandings of empire that focus on bilateral relations between metropole and colonial periphery, the book uncovers a half century of dynamic relations between Japan, Taiwan, China, and Western regional powers. Japanese officials in Taiwan did not simply take orders from Tokyo; rather, they often pursued their own expansionist ambitions in South China and Southeast Asia. When outright conquest was not possible, they promoted alternative strategies, including naturalizing resident Chinese as overseas Taiwanese subjects, extending colonial police networks, and deploying tens of thousands of Taiwanese to war. Drawing on multilingual archives in six countries,Imperial Gatewayshows how Japanese officials and Taiwanese subjects transformed Taiwan into a regional gateway for expansion in an ever-shifting international order.

This event will be available in-person in HUB 332 and online.To join us, please visit ourEventbrite page to register.

Seiji Shiraneis an Assistant Professor of Japanese History at The City College of New York (CUNY), where his teaching and research interests include Japan’s empire, Taiwan, and Sino-Japanese relations. He received degrees from Yale University (BA) and Princeton University (PhD), and his work has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Fulbright, Social Science Research Council, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

        As China slowly emerges from its self-imposed COVID-19 isolation and entry becomes easier for foreign businessmen, a critical question that has been pushed to the side will return to the fore: is European business still in love with China? When the pandemic began in 2020, Europe was China’s largest trading partner and Chinese investment into Europe was surging. Even then, however, European FDI into China was in a slump due to frustration with market access. China has since liberalized its investment rules for some sectors. Will that be enough to revive European interest? Or have the combined effects of China’s long Covid lockdowns and Washington’s concerns about China as a security threat caused European business to chill on China and shift their sights elsewhere?

        Towards the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 as Communist forces advanced southwards, aircraft of the Nationalist government’s two main airlines took refuge at Kai Tak airfield in the then British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. There followed a three-year struggle for control of the aircraft on the ground, in the courts and among ministers and diplomats on three continents.

In this seminar Malcolm Merry, author of the recently published Grounded at Kai Tak, Chinese Aircraft Impounded in Hong Kong 1949-1952 (HKUP), will outline the story of the struggle. It is a saga of colourful characters, political intrigue, legal manoeuverings and unexpected turns which strained the UK’s relations with the authorities in the US, Hong Kong and China. The British government insisted that ownership of the planes was purely a question of law but encountered resistance from the colony’s governor, its judges, the Americans and the new regime in China. The fate of the planes became entangled with international post-war tensions and domestic American politics which inevitably meant that the struggle was far more than a simple legal contest.

About the Speaker:
Malcolm Merry spent more than 40 years in Hong Kong as a practising barrister, author, lecturer/senior lecturer and associate/adjunct professor at the University of Hong Kong. He is known for his writing on land law but more recently has developed an interest in and published works on Hong Kong’s legal history including two books with HKUP, The Unruly New Territories (2020) and Grounded at Kai Tak (2022).

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnus is an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.
