Praised and occasionally criticized by Qing dynasty scholars as well as contemporary authorities, theShiji zhiyi史記志疑 of Liang Yusheng 梁玉繩 (1745-1819) is a detailed analysis and critique of Sima Qian’sShiji,the ancient Han dynasty account of China’s earliest dynasties and ruling houses from legendary times until the second century BCE. Over the last seven years I have been closely reading theShiji zhiyiand have produced a book-length study that focuses on Liang’s comments on theShijipassages that relate to the slow rise and precipitous fall of Qin, the first empire, and that weaves Liang’s scholarship into a revision of Sima Qian’s narration of the transformation of Qin from marginal state to hegemonic power. The book—published by Berkeley’s Institute of East Asian Studies in October 2023—provides an account of Liang’s lifeand methodology before turning to revisions of what theShijisays about Qin’s origins, the state’s ruling lineage, and its later kings and emperors, as well as the geography of the Qin state and empire, and the numerous battles from which Qin emerged as ultimate victor in 221 BCE. The foundation of these revisions is theShiji zhiyi. But on occasion I supplement and correct Liang’s scholarship by referring to the numerous archaeological discoveries that have dramatically altered our understanding of what happened in the history of early China. In my presentation I provide the examples of Liang’s methodology and the more dramatic revisions his scholarship suggests. My point is that, while there are imperfections in Liang’s work and points where his revisions are outdated, ill-founded, or incomplete, the translations and studies that ignore them or otherwise render, interpret, and adopt theShiji“as is” are at best misguided.

Women’s Entitlement in China’s Urbanization: Family Division of Relocated Housing Properties(Monday 19 August 2024)

Media, Gender and Politics: Representation of Female Political Leaders inThe People’s Daily(Monday 26 August 2024)

Gender quotas have a long history in China, with the earliest gender quota introduced in 1933 in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s border regions. Yet, research on China’s gender quotas has been scarce. This study addresses the gap by examining the process of gender quota adoption in China’s subnational Party-States and the People’s Congresses. Using an institutional approach, we argue that quota adoption in China was a process of “institutional layering” that lasted from the late 1980s to the 2010s, during which domestic actors contested the CCP’s existing personnel rules and strategically exploited the CCP’s ideological commitment to gender equity and its need for an improved international image during the second wave of global gender quota adoption. During the process, we see two changes: the slow diversification of domestic actors, including both state and non-state ones, and the shifting of the actors’ working strategy from an informal and network-based approach to an institutionalized one that operated through formal channels. In so doing, this article expands the comparative literature on gender quotas, which has been preoccupied with quotas in elected parliaments, and enriches understanding of Chinese politics.

        At an annual rate of 49 abortions per 1,000 reproductive-aged women, China has one of the highest abortion rates in the world. This presentation situates contemporary Chinese views of abortion within long-running debates about the ethics of abortion, its implications for gender equality, and its value as a tool of social engineering. Moreover, this lecture explains how abortion inadvertently became a primary method of fertility control in China

When Socialist Legacy Meets International Norms: Gender Quota Adoption and Institutional Change in China(Monday12 August 2024)

Media, Gender and Politics: Representation of Female Political Leaders inThe People’s Daily(Monday 26 August 2024)

This study examines family property structures in relocated rural communities in the urbanizing China. Drawing on survey and interview data from Ningxia, Northwestern China, this study illustrates how relocated housing properties were divided between male and female family members. The findings suggest that both gender and family structures matter in shaping family property structures. On the one hand, men tended to receive more housing properties across different families. On the other hand, women’s access to family properties is affected by mechanisms different from that of men. Given the changes in government policies and local customs, rural families have adapted their strategies of property management but patriarchal traditions have coexisted and interacted with new demands and new tensions among family members in the era of urbanization.

China’s economic and social development over the last 25 years has featured significant elements from the neoliberal playbook–ideologies of competition and human capital, market metrics, efficiency, suppression of labor rights, and more–coexisting with severe state limitations on private property, impediments to the formation of a capitalist class, and, especially in the last ten years, an expansion of state-owned enterprises and party control of the economy. This talk argues for the continued relevance of neoliberalism to an understanding of China today, and suggests that China’s particular and limited neoliberal character offers insights into the nature of contemporary capitalism, and of its antagonists.

Women’s Entitlement in China’s Urbanization: Family Division of Relocated Housing Properties(Monday 19 August 2024)

This presentation focuses on how Chinese female political leaders are represented in media, through the examination of the People’s Daily’s coverage of female Politburo members since 1949: Jiang Qing, Ye Qun, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yi, Liu Yandong and Sun Chunlan. Existing scholarship argues that media representation of women’s political life reflects existing gender norms of ‘public man, private women’, and largely sees the relationship between media, gender and political leadership as static.

The representation of early generations of female Chinese leaders confirms this view. This is illustrated by the cases of Jiang Qing and Ye Qun’s political roles being portrayed as mere mistakes, and the cases of Deng Yingchao’s public roles being seen as an extension of her domestic roles and extensive media attention being paid to Wu Yi’s private life. Since the last decade, however, there has been little difference between media representation of female and male politicians.

The authors argues that media representation of female politicians is a changing dynamic. In an authoritarian system, the changes can be caused by the varying needs of the dominant political party at different times. In the case of China, these are the needs of dealing with legitimacy crises, presenting a positive image to the outside world, and strengthening its centralized rule.

World Factory and After: Grass Stage and the Fate of Social Theater in Xi Jinping’s China

The Shanghai-based Grass Stage theater troupe performed versions of World Factory at various venues in China, Hong Kong, and North America from 2014-2016. World Factory, a non-narrative, experimental documentary-based production, considered China’s new working class from historical, subjective, psychic, and social perspectives. Performances were also venues for intense and heated discussion with the audience. 2016, as the character of the Xi Jinping regime became more and more clear, marked an apogee not only for the performance, but for the Chinese worker’s movement in general. This talk traces Grass Stage’s trajectory from World Factory to the present, and uses that trajectory as a diagnosis of the state of political subjectivity and the fate of social critique.

        Urban inhabitants have long had an emotional attachment to the cities they live in. This expresses itself through daily life, culture, and heritage. This talk highlights some of the ways in which urban populations in China have reflected on their emotional attachment to the city. Examples includehuaigupoetry mourning the loss of Luoyang, guidebooks that waxed lyrical on the sites of Ming Dynasty Nanjing, and emotional appeals to create socialist production cities in Maoist China.

Within this broader context of emotional attachment to place, one of the issues that inspires the most vigorous responses is heritage. Study of the protection, use, and development of heritage assets often focuses on their economic value and the local and broader politics around specific sites. However, to the people who are most attached to heritage, it is the emotional connection that is the most important. This talk explores examples from Hong Kong, such as the Star Ferry. It sets these in a global context by thinking about how emotional attachment to heritage is guiding urban policy and planning. As rapid urbanization sweeps all before it in skyscrapers of steel and glass, I ask whether prioritising an emotional approach to heritage has the potential to create cities that are more accessible, equitable, and sustainable.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

This program is a collaboration between theUS Heartland China AssociationandChina Institute in America.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
