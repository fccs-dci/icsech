        The May Fourth Movement (MFM) has been regarded as a watershed in Chinese history. It was more than student demonstration against unfair treatment of China at the Paris Peace Conference; it was a “movement of and for the people”. It was a movement that gave birth to a range of new ideas and “shaped China’s momentous twentieth century” by initiating political development and cultural renaissance in Chinese society. This seminar, on the eve of the May Fourth anniversary, has been drawn out of the recently published volume titled,China's May Fourth Movement: New Narratives and Perspectives,by Routledge (International). Edited by Prof. Sabaree Mitra, this volume provides critical insights into the MFM from interdisciplinary perspectives.

This seminar looks at various facets of the MFM– the development of the May Fourth Spirit (MFS), Lu Xun’s contributions and its impact on the Indian public sphere. Prashant Kaushik in his presentation, “The MFS and the Communist Party of China: Evolution and Significance of an Umbilical Relationship” shows how the MFS has been attributed with different connotations during different eras of the CPC’s history. Christian Uhl’s presentation is titled, “Evolution, Eternal Recurrence, and Lu Xun’s Struggle with the Aporetic Temporalities of Capitalist Modernity: Reapproaching Lu Xun’s Yecao (Xu, Guoke, Ying de Gaobie)”. He argues that “Darwinist ideas on evolution” were the most productive source of inspiration for the intellectuals of the MFM. Through an analysis of Lu Xun's Yecao, he demonstrates that this oeuvre has universal significance as the manifestation of a profound struggle in the dimension of time. Natasha Nongbri in her presentation on “The MFM in Indian Newsprint: Glimpses through the Times of India” argues that the May Fourth Movement became a metaphor for change that left an impression on the then Indian public sphere, providing a backdrop for the emergence of a pan-Asian solidarity movement.

        With China’s tacit support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been much talk in global media about a new China-Russia alliance against the West. This has been supported by evidence of military cooperation, such as joint naval drills in the East China Sea in December 2022, as well as Xi Jinping’s advocacy of an authoritarian “Beijing model” as an ideological and political alternative to the “Washington consensus”. But China and Russia have a long history of conflict as well, from imperial Russian aggressions against Qing China, to the Sino-Soviet split during the Cold War.

So what are the prospects for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century? How do mainland Chinese view Russia? We are joined by four scholars currently working on different aspects of China-Russia relations:


	Ed Pulford, Lecturer in Chinese Studies, Manchester (Chinese views of Putin; Sino-Russian friendship);
	Elena Barabantseva, Senior Lecturer in Politics, Manchester (male Chinese views of Russian and Ukrainian women);
	Tao Wang, Hallsworth Research Fellow, Manchester (what surveys reveal about Chinese attitudes towards the Russian invasion of Ukraine);
	Yi Wang, Assistant professor in politics, U. Birmingham (recent Chinese social media debates over Russia).

        In this talk, India China Institute’s Postdoctoral Fellow Sarandha Jain will discuss her PhD dissertation, which studies the oil-mediated relationship between the Indian state and citizens. Focusing on both oil production and consumption, presenting ethnography of oil refineries, research institutes, state offices, a peri-urban working-class-neighborhood near Delhi, and ‘black markets’, her talk examines oil as an infrastructure for the state and for society. She argues that the Indian state distributes itself into citizens’ lives via petroleum products, which obtain their sociopolitical agencies while being produced in certain ways, and play out those agencies while being consumed in certain ways. Her ethnography of refineries details out the microprocesses of oil refining and the complex relationship that human and nonhuman actors share. It elaborates on how politics get programmed into petroleum products, designed to discipline consumer-citizens into particular lifestyles, and how varying actors encumber this. Research on oil consumption with ‘black-marketeers’ and ordinary consumers of petroleum products, probes “distorted discipline”, where governmental plans get mangled by the informal practices of state actors as well as citizens. How does the politics programmed into petroleum products in refineries actually play out once other actors intervene, and snatch control over oil away from the state? Investigating this tussle between legalized and illegalized groups, she describes how it structures citizens’ lives, and the constellations of power and forms of sociality it gives rise to. This talk highlights the constant churning between the state and citizens through ever-evolving devices of government, as well as through escape from them. Specific modes of subjectification, engineered through flows of oil, lie at the heart of this churning, over which state-citizen formations are negotiated.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        A managed foreign exchange regime has been integral to the Chinese economy since 1949, but how did it come about? In this talk, I discuss its gradual formation from the Communist victory in 1948 – 49 to the first Canton Fair in 1957. While influenced by Soviet institutional models, the foreign exchange regime in early PRC era was built on an export- and remittance-oriented economy that only partially aligns with the new government’s geo-economic orientations. I trace the confluence of Yan’an-era and Nationalist techniques of reserve margin management on this era, and stress two previously under-discussed features — one, the impact of US-led embargo on official thinking on foreign exchange; and two, that we need to view and compare the Chinese experience as part of a global management of “hard” currency in the post-war era.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	Relationships with bureaucracies, commercial counterparts and civil society in host countries
	
	Communist party influence on organisational structure, style of operating and incentive and penalties for employees.
	
	How Chinese companies manage the complexities of operating in international environments including language, host country markets, unfamiliar political systems, and cultural milieus as well as with competition from other commercial entities.
	
	Case studies of particular Chinese companies operating abroad, or conversely, a range of Chinese companies operating in a particular host country.


The publishing outcomes of this conference will include a special issue proposal toThe China Journal.

If you are interested in participating, please send a 250 word abstract, a brief CV and your institutional affiliation to the conference organiser, Dr Greg Raymondgreg.raymond@anu.edu.auby30 March 2023. A limited number of travel bursaries may be available – please enquire if needed
