        MAO AND MARKETS: THE COMMUNIST ROOTS OF CHINESE ENTERPRISE

        It was long assumed that as China embraced open markets and private enterprise, its state-controlled economy would fall by the wayside, that free markets would inevitably lead to a more liberal society. Instead, China’s growth over the past four decades has positioned state capitalism as a durable foil to the orthodoxy of free markets, to the confusion of many in the West.

Christopher Marquis and Kunyuan Qiao argue that China’s economic success is based on—not in spite of—the continuing influence of Communist leader Mao Zedong. They illustrate how Mao’s ideological principles, mass campaigns, and socialist institutions have enduringly influenced Chinese entrepreneurs’ business strategies and the management of their ventures. Grounded in case studies and quantitative analyses, this book shows that while private enterprise is the engine of China’s growth, Chinese companies see no contradictions between commercial drive and a dedication to Maoist ideology.

        The talk will discuss the role of formal law in governing markets during China's &quot;Legalized Politicization Era&quot; (2010–present), the current era of market development in China. In this present era, the authorities over governing markets are being reconfigured to handle the consequences of prior era state capitalism. Such reconfiguration of market governance is achieved through the mobilization of legal institutions in two main directions: intensifying the presence of the regulatory state in the market, and shifting substantial market governance powers directly to the CCP.

The talk is based on the book:Law &amp;amp; Political Economy in China: The Role of Law in Corporate Governance &amp;amp; Market Growth, Cambridge University Press (2023). The book analyzes four decades of market development in China [1978-2021], discussing the role of law as an internal party-state instrument for allocating political-economic power. A substantial part of the book is dedicated to observing how relations of political-economic power are legally configured through the (re)construction of corporate laws and legal institutions.

        TRANSNATIONAL CHINESE RELIGION AS SHADOW INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG THE ‘MARITIME SILK ROAD’:   THE CASE OF WEST KALIMANTAN, INDONESIA

        In Singkawang, West Kalimantan the local Chinese Indonesian community is currently engaged in a major Chinese Religious revival in which inter-ethnic spirit-medium practices figure strongly. At the center of this revival are processes of recreating Chinese Indonesian identities in relation to both highly localized gods, spirits and territorially-grounded senses of belonging and re-sinicization processes that relate to transnational circulations of Chinese language education and media circulations within a greater Chinese cultural sphere. As China rises as a global superpower, manifesting political and economic hegemony through investments in ambitious infrastructural development projects along the territories within the imagined Belt Road Initiative (BRI), including the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) which runs through Indonesia, members of this socially, culturally and geographically peripheral community are realigning themselves symbolically and imaginatively with China as a social-historical force in the world. In this presentation, I will explain how this realignment rarely involves participating in large physical infrastructural projects of the BRI, but instead involves participating in the figurative and symbolic aspects of transnational Chinese Religion. I will explain how, alongside the material infrastructure, the figurative aspects of Chinese Religion act as a shadow infrastructure which transports practitioners into a transnational realm of stories, myths, and politics in which divine bureaucrats demonstrate their power (Man. shen and ling) by interacting with and intervening in peoples’ daily lives. By doing so, I hope to expand our understand of the concepts of both infrastructure and religion, and place into a productive tension concrete forms of infrastructural development and more figurative and imaginary dimensions of religious infrastructure.

        TheBelt and Road Initiative(BRI), or as the Chinese call it,Yīdài Yīlù,(一带一路),is a comprehensive global infrastructure developmentstrategy adopted by thePRC government in 2013 to invest in various countries and international organizations with the objective of bolstering China’s influence and connectivity. The initiative involves forging vital linkages between South-East Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes. BRI has proved beneficial for China leading to expanded markets, heightened trade opportunities, regional development, particularly in the Western regions such as Xinjiang, and an increased array of investment prospects. However, for other nations, it has prompted concerns, including the possibility of falling into debt traps and the displacement of job opportunities. From its inception, the prevailing view in India, as articulated by both the academic and strategic communities, as well as government entities, has been that the BRI is less an economic development initiative and more of a geopolitical and strategic endeavour. One of the most significant concerns for India, in this regard, pertains to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a crucial component of the BRI, which traverses through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK). This has raised substantial alarm in India as it infringes upon the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. As the Belt and Road Initiative commemorates its 10th anniversary, it is essential to engage in a comprehensive assessment and reflection on the significant impact, implications, and challenges that India encounters in connection with this initiative.

        - Abstract: The Grand Canal was an artificial waterway constructed in ancient times that is the longest of its kind and has the largest drainage area. It links the drainage basins of five major rivers: the Hai River, Yellow River, Huai River, Yangtze River, and Qiantang River, is 3200 km in length, and an extraordinary feat of human engineering. In 2014, the Grand Canal was received by UNESCO into the World Heritage List, while in 2016, the Chinese government assigned the Grand Canal National Culture Park status as a National Major Cultural Project. The Grand Canal has had a unique influence on the structure of Chinese civilization itself and on China’s economic development, social management, and literature and art, as well as on international cultural exchange. It is a historical and cultural phenomenon that is worthy of close attention and has had an inspirational impact on how China of recent times is to be understood.

Lecture 2: The Fates of the Last Rulers of the Warring States
2023/10/13 │ 16:00 – 17:30
It has been argued that we know little about what happened to these rulers with the exception of the famous story of Heir Dan of Yan. Yet Han-dynasty texts like the Shiji and the Han shu as well as the accounts in the Zizhi tongjian and Ming and Qing literary works reveal much about these royal clans and their descendants. This lecture will attempt to select several examples from these last rulers to show that we can postulate in more detail some of their fates.

        Stopping “Gray Rhinos”, Handling “Black Swans” and Removing “Tigers Blocking the Way”: Assessing Challenges and Exploring Prospects for U.S.-China Relations in 2024

Four months after a wayward surveillance blew his impending visit off course, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing to set about erecting the ‘guardrails’ U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping envisaged in Bali in November 2022. Secretary Blinken was followed in quick succession by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Special Climate Envoy John Kerry, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Reciprocally, Beijing’s new Ambassador to the U.S. Xie Feng continues to adjust to his new role, appointed in March, and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi is anticipated to formally visit Washington in the coming months. With this uptick and revival of in-person visits, the United States and China appear to be inching closer to stabilizing their rocky relationship; a goal that both nations have emphasized this year. As the two sides return to their Bali agenda, a critical next step will be to translate their mutual intentions into real actions.

Is that possible at this late hour in the Biden administration’s term in office? Can the two sides take specific steps to resolutely stop “gray rhinos”, properly handle “black swans” and thoroughly remove “tigers blocking the way”, and thus create conditions and remove disruptions for stabilizing U.S.-China relations? Or with election season looming, is the exchange of good intentions about the best that can be expected from the two sides? Will the window to stabilize ties shut tight by the end of the year as election polemics kick-in and China is used as a beating stick by the Biden administration’s political opponents? What does 2024 portend for U.S.-China relations, both politically and on the economic decoupling front?

        The Twentieth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held in October 2022, will go down as the congress at which Xi Jinping secured a third term, perhaps opening the way for the restoration of life-long tenure. Perhaps more important, however, the congress appointed Xi’s close political associates to fill out the Politburo Standing Committee and most of the Politburo. Not including people from contending wings of the party makes the new leadership the most personalistic in party history (even Mao contended with strong people in the party), thus making the party qua party less important. The historical record of personalistic regimes is not good; one can only hope that Xi Jinping can avoid the catastrophic errors of many personalistic regimes.

        In 1932, a group of leftist poets in Shanghai established the China Poetry Society, aiming to produce poetry that would enlighten and mobilize the masses to be the self-conscious political subject. This talk revisits the poetic works and theories of the members of the Society, focusing in particular on the extensive discussion on the historical origin and political relevance of poetic rhythm and its relationship with labor. Tracking the transnational circulation and transformation of the new knowledge of bodily rhythm and poetic rhythm since the late 19th century, this talk shows how a new conception of poetic rhythm as a mediating and mobilizing device gave rise to a series of leftist poetic experiments that attempted to construct the collective political subject through invoking the bodily solidarity of the laboring masses.

        For the last seven decades, world politics has been dominated by American leadership, the institutions it has designed, and putatively liberal norms. This international order is facing severe challenges due to the rise of new powers, breakdown of old economic arrangements, and a redistribution of technological and infrastructural activity. This academic year, we are planning a series of panels that seek to examine emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older international order.

The November 2nd panel there will be a panel that discusses how global governance institutions reflect changing geopolitics and international political economy. We hope to deliberate on the impact of new powers like China, India, and other countries in the global South, and how they are leading to new distributions of power, norms, and expertise.
