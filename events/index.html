        People tend to think of decolonization in Asia as being a phenomenon of the Cold War Era, where European colonizers, having survived humiliating blows of Japanese occupation of their Asian colonies during the Second World War, reluctantly but unavoidably relinquished their suzerainty and allowed numerous new nation-states to emerge in the Asia-Pacific through the first three decades of the postwar period.

In reality, the South China Sea and its surrounding political entities have always been a realm of influence of a superpower external to the region; the British Empire during the Colonial Era and the US through much of the latter half of the 20thcentury. No sooner US influence started to recede with the conclusion of the Cold War, than South China Sea starts to experience the hegemonic encroachment of rising China. Taiwan feels the heat of increasing PRC pressure upon her precarious independent status in the global arena, while Hong Kong’s freedom once guaranteed by the Basic Law and the ‘1 country 2 systems’ principle has been continuously and methodically dismantled from the earliest years of Xi Jinping’s presidency. The democratizing trend of Southeast Asia has suffered similar setbacks, with Thailand and Myanmar reverting back to military rule and returning to draconian measures to suppress pro-democracy protesters.

The online pro-democracy network known as the ‘Milk Tea Alliance,’ which emerged in April 2020, among netizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, is the first online movement to vocalize what has been a long standing yet unspeakable suspicion among the younger generation of this region—that the Chinese Communist Government is a mutual obstacle for democratization of the Asia-Pacific. For the first time in history, the fight for Taiwan independence, Hong Kong’s freedom, and Thailand and Myanmar’s democratization becomes one and the same, united by the superpower threat against democracy and human rights in the form of PRC influence across the region. The ‘Milk Tea Alliance’ quest for freedom is the last of the unfinished business from the colonial era. It is the long overdue last wave of decolonization in Asia.

        The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which prompted immediate censure and sanctions against Russia by Western governments, has been met with a more ambivalent response by China and India. While both governments have issued statements deploring the harm to civilians and loss of life, for different reasons, they have abstained from United Nations’ resolutions condemning Russia and sought ways to avoid having to choose sides with either the US-led coalition or with Russia. To understand the responses to the conflict, please join a panel featuring foreign policy analysts from India and China.

        DRAMAS OF CATASTROPHES: AMERICAN AND CHINESE GOVERNMENTS’ CULTURAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS

        In an ongoing project, Xu examines the American and Chinese governments’ cultural responses to the COVID-19 crisis. “Cultural response,” defined as the governments’ symbolic action to address their citizens’ suffering and death in disasters, is often neglected by scholars and dismissed by public opinion as secondary and insignificant. But Xu argues that governments must win people’s hearts and minds through sympathetic, meaningful words and actions about their reactions, accountability, and visions, in addition to their supplies, funds, and managerial actions. Drawing on the dramaturgical approach and a comparative study, Xu shows how the two governments’ cultural responses have been shaped by their different types of regimes, political structures, and particular situations. Xu also intends to develop and extend the dramaturgical approach to disaster management, a topic that has been studied mostly from the managerial and practical perspective in the mainstream paradigm.

Join us near the 232rd anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's death on April 12, 1790 to see what came of his last bet—a gift of 2,000 pounds to Boston and Philadelphia, to be lent out to tradesmen over the next two centuries to jump‑start their careers. Each loan would be repaid with interest over ten years. If all went according to Franklin’s inventive scheme, the accrued final payout in 1991 would be a windfall.

InBenjamin Franklin’s Last Bet, Michael Meyer traces the evolution of these twin funds as they age alongside America itself, bankrolling woodworkers and silversmiths, trade schools and space races. Over time, Franklin’s wager was misused, neglected, and contested—but never wholly extinguished. With charm and inquisitive flair, Meyer shows how Franklin’s stake in the “leather-apron” class remains in play to this day, and offers an inspiring blueprint for prosperity in our modern era of growing wealth disparity and social divisions.

        The so-called “Mindful Revolution” sweeping through mainstream American popular culture has tended to overshadow both the deep historical roots of the connections between Buddhism and health, as well as the diversity of those Buddhist healing methods beyond merely meditation. This talk places the contemporary focus on the health benefits of mindfulness within the history of Buddhist engagements with medicine, with particular attention to China. It outlines the many rich and complex approaches to healing that have been (and still are in many cases) used in Chinese Buddhist communities, both in order to learn more about Chinese culture and also to suggest directions for further historical and clinical research beyond mindfulness.

        A LONG ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY OF THE LOESS PLATEAU: CONFLICT, EXTRACTION AND INTENSIFICATION BETWEEN BIOMES

        The Loess Plateau is a tectonic block surrounded by the Yellow River and comprised of the world's largest formation of loess soil. Loess, a silt-like sediment that accumulated in the region over the past two million years, has excellent drainage capacities when it is covered with vegetation, but is highly prone to erosion when ground cover is removed. The loess plateau also receives unpredictable amounts of rainfall each year and becomes significantly more arid from south to north.

These two characteristics of the Loess Plateau - its unpredictable rainfall and its propensity to experience erosion - have both had profound effects on its long term history. At various times, the loess plateau has been a site of imperial capitals and state-sponsored colonization; a highly fortified frontier encompassing multiple polities and modes of subsistence, and a focus for commercial extraction of timber, salt, and other commodities.

This talk explains how the Loess Plateau has shaped, and has been shaped by, a range of human activities over the past three thousand years.

        Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia has increased dramatically since 2013 when the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was announced. The dominant investments have been in infrastructure development, power plant construction and mineral extraction and processing. In a recent collaboration with the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, the Research Center for Climate Change at the University of Indonesia (RCCC-UI) conducted a spatial environmental assessment of 14 clusters of BRI projects throughout Indonesia. The research project seeks to understand the environmental and social impacts of the projects by focusing on a project’s distance from primary forest, trends of vegetation and carbon loss, emission of nitrous oxide (NOx) as a dangerous air pollutant, the presence of selected endangered species and the presence of affected Indigenous Peoples.

Join us on Wednesday, April 20, for a discussion on the spatial environmental assessment of select BRI projects in Indonesia, featuring Rebecca Ray and University of Indonesia researchers Albertus Hadi Pramono, Masita Dwi Mandini Manessa, Mochamad Indrawan and Dwi Amalia Sari. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        The 2015 revision of China’s Administrative Litigation Law caused an explosive increase in courts’ workload, including a surge in Chinese citizens suing local governments over property expropriation. Professor Shitong Qiao of the Duke School of Law, one of the leading scholars of Chinese property law, and Professor Chaoqun Zhan, an economist at Lingnan College, Sun Yat-sen University, will share their research into how that surge affected court decisions. Perhaps surprisingly, they found that busy Chinese courts are more likely to uphold plaintiffs’ claims against the government. Frank Upham, the Wilf Family Professor of Property Law at NYU Law School, will moderate.

        As the United States and China find themselves caught in a great power struggle, the rest of the world is left watching. Middle power countries–such as Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and South Korea–now find themselves caught in between the toxic struggle between the United States and China for global prominence and power. These countries have been left to wage their own diplomatic battles as they try to balance decades–or even centuries–of historic relations with economic priorities, security initiatives, and their own national values; all while aiming to maintain global stability and foster their own national growth. While many of these countries find themselves in similar situations as a ‘middle power’ country, they also inevitably hold their own unique needs and desires–for both the state of U.S.-China relations and for the global stage as a whole–that cannot be ignored.

While it is important to understand China and America’s global visions from their respective perspectives, it is also important to assess this bilateral relationship from the perspectives of other global actors. In the globalized world that we live in today, third party countries, especially these middle power countries, are important partners for both China and the U.S. to engage and manage global challenges. The middle powers are essentially the “middle-class” members of the global society that uphold the status quo and stabilize the international system. Thus, hearing from the middle powers can provide fresh perspectives on the inevitable realities of the U.S.-China relationship. It also helps provide a bystander’s perspective for policymakers in Washington and Beijing to search for ‘guardrails’ in their increasingly competitive relationship.

This event will bring together scholars representing five middle power countries–Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and South Korea–to present and discuss their country’s perspectives on the increasingly competitive U.S.-China relationship to ultimately build a better understanding of middle power countries’ unique and important perceptions of–and role within–the U.S.-China relationship.

        This lecture explores the life of an elite woman, raised in Beijing and educated at a missionary school during the May Fourth era. Daughter of a Beiyang reformer, wife of a Nationalist official educated at MIT, mother of an underground Communist revolutionary, she herself left no direct trace in the public record. She emerges primarily in interviews with her son, and in an unfinished and unpublished historical novel by her daughter. Filial love, household management, sexual propriety, wifely duty, maternal loyalty, domestic cosmopolitanism, and shrewd political judgment mingle in her story, raising questions about where revolution lies and how we should track its less visible effects. Her life illuminates the gendered effects of China’s long revolution, the central importance of women as symbols of the nation, and the limits of what we can know about the past.

This event is the second in a four-part series for WEAI's Asia in Action workshop series, &quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC.&quot;

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

The next two events in this series are:

Wed. April 27 / 12:00 – 1:30pm

Chinese History in the Age of Big Data

        China has become deeply integrated in the world economy, yet gradual marketization has facilitated the country’s rise without a wholesale assimilation to global neoliberalism. In her new book, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy: The Market Reform Debate,” Isabella Weber uncovers the fierce contest for economic reforms that shaped China’s path. In the first post-Mao decade, reformers were sharply divided: should China destroy the core of the socialist system through shock therapy, or should it use the institutions of the planned economy as market creators? With hindsight, the historical record proves the high stakes behind the question: China embarked on an economic expansion commonly described as unprecedented in scope and pace, whereas Russia’s economy collapsed under shock therapy.

Based on extensive research, including interviews with key Chinese and international participants and World Bank officials as well as insights gleaned from unpublished documents, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy” charts the debate that ultimately enabled China to follow a path to gradual reindustrialization. Beyond shedding light on the crossroads of the 1980s, it reveals the intellectual foundations of state-market relations in reform-era China through a longue durée lens. Overall, the book delivers an original perspective on China’s economic model and its continuing contestations from within and from without.

Join us on Thursday, April 21, for a discussion with Isabella Weber, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, on her new book and China’s path of economic reform. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global Economic Governance Book Talk Series.

        For our April book club we’re reading Joan Is Okay in preparation for our chat with the author, Weike Wang. --- Joan is a thirty-something ICU doctor at a busy New York City hospital. The daughter of Chinese parents who came to the United States to secure the American dream for their children, Joan is intensely devoted to her work, happily solitary, successful. She does look up sometimes and wonder where her true roots lie: at the hospital, where her white coat makes her feel needed, or with her family, who try to shape her life by their own cultural and social expectations.

Join us on the 232rd anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's death on April 12, 1790 to see what came of his last bet—a gift of 2,000 pounds to Boston and Philadelphia, to be lent out to tradesmen over the next two centuries to jump‑start their careers. Each loan would be repaid with interest over ten years. If all went according to Franklin’s inventive scheme, the accrued final payout in 1991 would be a windfall.

InBenjamin Franklin’s Last Bet, Michael Meyer traces the evolution of these twin funds as they age alongside America itself, bankrolling woodworkers and silversmiths, trade schools and space races. Over time, Franklin’s wager was misused, neglected, and contested—but never wholly extinguished. With charm and inquisitive flair, Meyer shows how Franklin’s stake in the “leather-apron” class remains in play to this day, and offers an inspiring blueprint for prosperity in our modern era of growing wealth disparity and social divisions.

        Queer feminist writing — on lived experiences of gender, race, and queerness — resists mainstream understandings of what “counts” as theory or scholarship. What does it mean for a junior scholar to undertake these forms of writing and speaking in the academy today?

In this talk, I take up my embodiment as a “woman of color” academic to trace my positionality in transnational movements between the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Namely, I reflect upon my recent publications that center on such experiences, as well as the process of choosing to undertake and then continue with this work as a queer and feminist studies scholar. Out of necessity, such writing draws not only from fields closest to my training — Japanese studies and queer theory — but also from women of color and Asian American feminisms, transnational feminisms, and Sinophone studies.

But how do I seek to translate queer feminist writing and experience for others? Hong Kong has served as an irreplaceable site of becoming where my aims as a queer feminist have been sharpened and even dramatically transformed in response to the political contexts in which I now write and teach. Teaching and writing have equally shaped my life during difficult times. Given arguments concerning the “defeat” or “collapse” of Hong Kong feminism, I end by considering the significance of what I call “queer feminist theory” in Hong Kong today.

        Digitization facilitates censorship in Chinese archives, but it also gives us new tools to study censorship and to renew the historian's craft. This talk explores the opportunities and challenges of studying twentieth-century Chinese history in the digital age. Drawing on archival statistics and metadata from several provincial collections, it begins by taking stock of the archival landscape in contemporary China: What has been made available (and not?). It then applies the latest digital methods to query the genre of &quot;nianpu&quot; (chronicles) in the Chinese Communist Party historiography. Using techniques such as named entity recognition and network analysis, it reveals internal connections and textual discrepancies to raise new questions about elite politics and political communication in Mao's China. The talk will end with ideas for digital study of modern Chinese history and practical suggestions for research data management in the age of information overload and official surveillance.

        The Center for Chinese Studies introduces a new book by Professor Franklin Perkins along with a Faculty Dialogue. For more than two thousand years, the writings of the Confucian philosopher Mengzi have been a source of guidance and inspiration for those set on doing something to improve the state of the world. Doing What You Really Want: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mengzi presents a coherent, systematic, and accessible explanation of Mengzi's philosophy. The book covers everything from the place of human beings in nature to human psychology and philosophy of emotions, to the various ways in which we can deliberately change and cultivate ourselves. Mengzi was concerned not just with theory but also effective action. Perkins thus includes a collection of practical advice and a Confucian analysis of politics-oriented toward how individuals can make a difference in the world. This event is co-sponsored by the UHM Department of Philosophy.

Franklin Perkins is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa and is the editor of the journal Philosophy East and West. Before coming to UH, he taught at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) and at DePaul University (Chicago), where he was Director of the Chinese Studies Program; Jim Behuniak is a Professor of Philosophy at Colby College. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Hawai`i in 2002; George Tsai is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawaii. His interests are primarily in moral and political philosophy, and, more recently, early Chinese philosophy.

        MASS TIMBER: ENGINEERED WOOD AND MATERIAL MODERNITY IN THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

        How did materials shape everyday technology in the People’s Republic of China? And what might a material history of socialist China look like? Steel and cotton were among the most famous materials, widely discussed, heavily politicized, and prominent in everyday life between the 1950s and 1980s. Yet there were several other notable materials such as plastics, synthetic fibres, aluminium, concrete, glass, or engineered woods. While these often make an appearance in historiography, they are more commonly extras rather than protagonists. Taking the example of engineered woods, this presentation explores how plywood, particleboard, and fibreboard were researched, developed, made, used, and debated as part of making a socialist everyday through technologies of all kind. From the Great Leap Forward campaign to manufacture fibreboard in small local factories as part of an attempt to supply communities with more objects of use, to the rapid rise of particle- and fibreboard as the backbones of light industrial modernization during “reform and opening”, the stories of engineered wood reveal the everyday material dimensions of mass mobilization, industrialisation, and socialist governance over time.

        Over the past 21 years, Chinese policy and commercial banks, government entities, companies and other financiers have financed billions of dollars of infrastructure, energy and development projects throughout Africa. Since 2016, financing has steadily declined, dropping from a peak of $28.4 billion to $8.3 billion in 2019.

The COVID-19 pandemic, the most serious global health crisis of the past century, has severely impacted development and commercial finance budgets around the world, including China’s. For many African countries in particular, the pandemic has also had severe social and economic impacts. Already fragile welfare systems have been threatened or overwhelmed and African intraregional and international trade, investment flows and access to financing has also been adversely affected. The full impact is still unfolding.

Amid these economic impacts, how has the pandemic impacted Chinese lending to Africa? What trends have emerged and which have endured? How have Chinese financiers adapted to changing economic and political conditions in Africa as they learn from experiences with borrowers in debt distress and debt restructuring negotiations? And what factors might shape Chinese lending to Africa in the post-pandemic era?

On Thursday, April 28, 9:00-10:00 AM EDT / 15:00-14:00 CET, join the Boston University Global Development Policy Center for a webinar discussion and 2020 data release for the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.

        For the past three centuries, Pu Songling 蒲松齡 (1640-1715) the author ofStrange Tales from a Chinese Studio聊齋誌異has cast a dizzying, hallucinatory spell on his reader, drawing them into the spiritual, emotional and erotic depths of the Chinese Realm of Fantasy. Written in a highly eloquent, witty and allusive form of classical Chinese, his Tales explore in great detail the richly sensuous under-world and dream-world of the traditional Chineseliteratus.

        Chinese food has been at the center of increasing anti-Chinese (Asian) sentiment since the advent of COVID-19. As the exceptionally high rate of Chinese takeout restaurants forced to close in 2020 indicates, the pandemic has reinforced a long-held racist view of Chinese food as unhealthy and unhygienic. This panel addresses how we can help to solve this problem by incorporating cooking and eating as a critical teaching component in Asian and Asian-American history classes. More specifically, it will ask what kinds of teaching methods we can experiment with when approaching food (arguably one of the most engaging themes) as an historical subject. It will also explore how we can encourage students to ask critical questions regarding Chinese food in terms of its consumption and production in order for them to appreciate the unlikely interplay of food and racial politics. Finally, it will address how the hands-on experience of cooking, which includes grocery shopping and recipe research as well as eating and sharing, can serve as a powerful teaching tool for promoting such values as diversity, inclusion, and respect in a pandemic era. Two speakers will present on their experience of teaching on this theme, which will be followed by a discussion with the audience.

This event will take place as part of WEAI’s ongoing series, “Asia in Action: Knowledge and Inclusion in a Time of Fear and Ignorance.”

        Policemen served a pivotal role in the politics of the Mao era, yet we know little about these important historical actors. Wang's paper draws upon rich archival records of police work reports to county authorities in western China from 1949 and 1963 to examine everyday practices of policing. In particular, Wang looks at the reported operation of a county police department in dealing with population movement and household registrations, which served as foundations for executing policies related to social order, political prosecution, and economic redistribution. Wang's paper analyzes these police reports with a focus on the language used, the venue and manner in which investigations were conducted, and explanations for conclusions reached. In doing so, this research sheds light on the close connections between investigative methods, the making of bureaucrats, and narrative construction as a practice of policing.

This event is the last in a four-part Asia in Action workshop series,&quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC&quot; at WEAI.

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

        Rapid coastal development presents substantial risks to marine habitats, biodiversity and coastal communities dependent upon vital marine ecosystem services. Noting that China is now the world’s largest bilateral creditor of overseas development finance, Blake Alexander Simmons, Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources at Colorado State University, will present a new study investigating the extent to which coastal development projects financed by Chinese development finance institutions present both direct and indirect risks to marine habitats, threatened species, marine protected areas and coastal Indigenous communities. Simmons will discuss where risks are greatest and how this knowledge can be used to create an agenda for “blue-ing” China’s overseas development finance portfolio.

Join us on Wednesday, May 18, for a discussion on mapping the risks of China’s global coastal development to marine socio-ecological systems. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        What constitutes being human? What are the boundaries or fuzzy edges of humanity? What can we learn from exploring the margins of humanity? These questions lie at the heart of this symposium, which will bring together twelve scholars across a variety of fields to consider how concepts analogous to our contemporary idea of “the human” were defined and debated in Medieval China.

We hope that the papers assembled for the symposium will open new, interdisciplinary vistas on the ways in which ethnocultural others, sociological underclasses, striking and different individuals, animals and gods, and ex- and future-humans were conceptualized and written about in the medieval period, and on the ways in which these marginal beings expressed and challenged the self-understandings of the authors of the materials that survive to us.

The symposium will be held via Zoom from 10am to 1pm, EST, on June 1st through June 3rd, 2022. Registration is free andopen to the public.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
