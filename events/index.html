In The Oldtimers, his third collection of poetry, Wing Tek Lum imagines life in Honolulu Chinatown circa 1900, giving voice to the forgotten pioneer generation of sojourners and settlers, detailing the trials and temptations of this bachelor society living far from their homeland - their hard work, their diversions, their challenges, and, even amidst the notorious plague and fire, their perseverance. For the EALL Talk Series, Wing Tek will share certain poems inspired by his research into the unique history and customs of this immigrant community at the turn of the last century.

This event is co-sponsored by the Center for Chinese Studies. We thank the Center and the C.Q. Yee Grant for supporting the Center’s speaker series on “Chinese Heritage in Hawaii: Connections, Contestations, and Collaborations,” of which Wing Tek Lum is the first speaker.

Wing Tek Lum is a Honolulu businessman and poet. Bamboo Ridge Press has published three collections of his poetry: Expounding the Doubtful Points (1987), The Nanjing Massacre: Poems (2012), and The Oldtimers (newly released).

The talk is open to the public.
There will be a short reception with refreshments after the talk.

        LAW AS INFRASTRUCTURE: CHINA IN THE WORLD

        Private law scholars have viewed Anglo-American common law as the core infrastructure of modern capitalism the world over. But what happens when rising powers like China with very different legal and political systems begin investing abroad on a vast scale? Our speaker, Matthew Erie, associateprofessor at the University of Oxford, responded to this question by launching a six-year project, calledChina, Law, and Development,and inviting scholars around the world to participate in gathering empirical evidence about the legal underpinnings of China’s worldwide investments, and whether or how China has disrupted prior assumptions about the relationship between law and development. In this talk, he will introduce the concept of “law as infrastructure” to make sense of the strategies and challenges of the People’s Republic of China. Rather than a “clash of civilizations” or a world remade in China’s image, law as infrastructure points to a process of layering, assembling, and bundling different laws and legal regimes including new law that is integrated within existing frameworks, epistemic communities, and institutions, as well as the creation of new infrastructures in emerging sectors such as renewable energy. Chinese law as global infrastructure has implications not only for commercial transactions but also for core fundamentals of public ordering, including rights, equity, and justice, in China and beyond.

        From 1940 to 1945, the United States relied heavily on a steady stream of Chinese tungsten ore, hog bristles, and tung oil in order to power American wartime industry. The flow of Chinese products to the United States was only possible with the efforts of a small handful of Chinese businessmen who served as the linchpins in a vast wartime production network that channeled raw materials from China’s rural hinterland to American factories. The wartime efforts of these businessmen helped lay the foundation for a postwar, Cold War order that was shored up through the exchange of resources for dollars with allied countries throughout Latin America and the Pacific. In this talk, I will focus on one of these businessmen, a man named Li Guoqin or K.C. Li, who was later known as China’s “Tungsten King,” to reveal the powerful role that these businessmen played in shaping the dimensions of American power in East Asia, Latin America, and the wider Cold War world.

        In the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai became a dynamic metropolis, blending Western influences with traditional Chinese culture and creating a unique urban atmosphere. This fusion of ideas and aesthetics shaped every aspect of city life, especially cinema, which was pivotal in expressing and influencing this cultural combination.

Gu Si-Yang examines films from this era that captured the tensions between tradition and progress, offering a window into a society’s hopes, struggles, and aspirations on the verge of transformation. This speech delves deeper into these cinematic and cultural developments, exploring their lasting impact on Shanghai and the broader trajectory of Chinese modernity.

Addressing misperceptions of the region is important for understanding Southeast Asia’s responses to some of the great global tensions and geopolitical shifts of the present, from U.S.-China tensions to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. Kausikan will also discuss how Southeast Asia's actions could serve as models for other regions.

        In China, recent reforms have aimed at expanding social security coverage, improving healthcare, and addressing rural-urban disparities. India has launched several ambitious welfare schemes aimed at poverty alleviation, healthcare, food security, and right to work programs. By virtue of population size, these programs are among the largest social policy initiatives in the world. But they are also insightful examples of welfare provision based less on rights-based entitlements and more on achieving state goals of development, social stability, political loyalty, and promotion of more exclusive conceptions of citizenship. This panel explores changing welfare policies and politics in China and India, and their roles in anchoring new forms of authoritarian or illiberal governance.

        State-building in conflict-prone societies faces the challenge of autonomous armed groups. We argue that military centralization, while strengthening a state’s ability to control the upper elites of these armed groups, can weaken the state's coercive capacity by reducing discipline and efficiency among the lower ranks in these groups. This talk studies a centralization reform in China’s Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), and finds that centralization reduced rebellions by local generals but led to more mutinies in the lower ranks of the military, more civilian uprisings, and worse battlefield performance. These findings highlight the complex effects of military centralization on the state’s coercive capacity, often overlooked in political science. (Co-author: Joy Chen)

        &quot;Good Wife, Wise Mother”: Assimilating Han Taiwanese Under Japanese Rule

In 1897, two years after Japan began its half-century rise as an imperial power, it inaugurated an ambitious experiment to make modern Japanese citizens out of Han Taiwanese schoolgirls in its first overseas colony, Taiwan. The goal of the segregated education was to train Taiwanese boys and men to become government clerks and teachers, and girls and women to become “good wives, wise mothers” (ryōsai kenbo). This gendered education was part of dōka, the Japanese assimilation program, as it sought to make everyone in the empire “Japanese” as equals by teaching the Japanese language and imperial ethics with gendered roles. Constructed by engaging with the cult of domesticity in the West that envisioned the home as a private space for women and the workplace as a public space for men to build strong nation-states, “good wife, wise mother” emerged in Japan in the 1890s and was introduced to Taiwan in the same decade.

Using periodicals and Japanese language textbooks, I examine the discourse and implementation of this ideal womanhood in Taiwan. This ideal of womanhood was crucial to the civilizing mission of the colonizers. Japanese colonial authority used gender to increase the supposed distance of civilizational levels between the colonizer and the colonized. By introducing gender into the discussion on dōka in Taiwan, I show that the promise of equality and inclusion from dōka became even less attainable and thus slowed assimilation to the supposedly superior Japanese civilization when colonial officials and educators characterized the colonized as feminine and depicted colonized women as the symbol of Taiwan’s “backwardness.”

Gendered assimilation became almost attainable for the Taiwanese toward the end of World War II compared to the pre-war dōka efforts. Ethnic and class divisions were blurred during wartime mobilization as the colonial government expanded the responsibilities of schoolgirls and women, thus blurring the distinction between Taiwanese and Japanese. Wartime mobilization redefined gendered assimilation in colonial Taiwan, as it shifted the training and focus of “good wives, wise mothers”, from the individual households only, to the entire empire, which meant that schoolgirls were trained to become “good wives, wise mothers” of the empire.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

        This study is based on a database encompassing all instances of political succession in imperial China, constructed by the speaker from a large collection of historical sources. The analysis reveals that only half of the designated successors in the two millennia of imperial Chinese history successfully ascended to power. These divergent outcomes are best explained by the age of the ruling monarch, the age gap between the ruling monarch and the designated successor, and the presence or absence of powerful officials at court. These findings the conventional wisdom that uses primogeniture to explain political succession and instead emphasizes the influence of non-institutional factors.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
