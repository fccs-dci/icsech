        Timothy A. Gelatt Dialogue on the Rule of Law in East Asia: Climate Change in Asia-Pacific

Panel 3: US-Japan Partnership in Climate Change

Discussions of US-Japanese cooperation often focus on geopolitics and trade. This panel will examine the ways in which the two governments, working separately and together, have shaped the global architecture for addressing climate change. Tomoaki Ishigaki, a minister at the Embassy of Japan to the United States, and Pete Ogden, vice president for energy, climate, and the environment at the United Nations Foundation, will explain how the US and Japan have interacted with each other and other major players in climate negotiations, analyze the dynamics between domestic constraints and international action, and suggest areas for closer cooperation to address the accelerating global crisis. Bruce Aronson will moderate the discussion.

        I am an Associate Professor (tenured) of Political Science at Temple University. I co-direct the Certificate in Political Economy, a program of the College of Liberal Arts. I am also a faculty affiliate of Global Studies and Asian Studies at Temple. I have served as a Global Order Visiting Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania's Perry World House. My research focuses on International and Comparative Political Economy of Development. I am completing my next book, under contract with Cambridge University Press, which investigates the mediating role of market governance in the relationship between global economic integration and development outcomes across industrial sectors in China, India, and Russia. Other ongoing projects examine China’s foreign economic engagement and its political impact on the developing world; and the political economy of identity in the global era.

What is the relationship between internal development and integration into the global economy in developing countries? How and why do state–market relations differ? And do these differences matter in the post-cold war era of global conflict and cooperation? Drawing on research in China, India, and Russia and examining sectors from textiles to telecommunications, Micro-institutional Foundations of Capitalism introduces a new theory of sectoral pathways to globalization and development. Roselyn Hsueh is an associate professor of political science at Temple University, where she co-directs the Certificate in Political Economy. She is the author of &quot;Micro-Institutional Foundations of Capitalism: Sectoral Pathways to Globalization in China, India, and Russia&quot; (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming, 2022) and &quot;China’s Regulatory State: A New Strategy for Globalization&quot; (Cornell University Press, 2011).

        Timothy A. Gelatt Dialogue on the Rule of Law in East Asia: Climate Change in Asia-Pacific

Panel 4: Corporate Governance and Climate Change in Asia-Pacific

States take the center stage at global climate negotiations, but corporations sit squarely in the crosshairs as contributors to climate change, casualties of the fallout, and indispensable participants in any response. Governments, investors, and publics across Asia-Pacific are increasingly demanding that corporations do more to address the climate crisis. Jennifer G. Hill at Monash University School of Law, Yumiko Miwa at Meiji University School of Commerce, and Umakanth Varottil at National University of Singapore School of Law will discuss changing views on the social role of corporations and corporate governance in Australia, India, and Japan from a comparative perspective.Bruce Aronson will moderate the discussion.

        This presentation takes a look at how transnational interactions developed in the “adolescence” of Sino-Southeast Asian contact, in the time period roughly covered by the thousand years between 600 and 1600 CE.We know very little about the “infancy” of these dealings, in the years before the T’ang.But by that dynasty, patterns of interaction slowly began to develop on a more systemic basis with Southeast Asia.I examine the growth and eventual flourishing of these interactions, and try to situate them in the larger milieu of what is now often called the “maritime silk road”. I end with some thoughts on what these trade patterns meant in the larger scheme of things, as “adolescence” eventually gave way to a complicated adulthood in these relationships after 1600 or so.

Literary imaginations about modern China are often synonymous with imaginations about “new people.” This talk focuses on how such imaginations unfolded and evolved in 20th-century Chinese science fiction. In particular, it calls attention to the dynamic interaction between translation and creation, and to the genre’s close engagement with ongoing ideological and literary debates within the national context. Jing Jiang is Associate Professor of Chinese and Humanities at Reed College. She teaches courses on Chinese language, literature, and culture. Aside from her book on twentieth century Chinese science fiction, she is also published in Asian Cinema, Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, Cultural Critique, and positions. She received the ACLS Pauline Yu Fellowship in 2020, and is currently working on a new book project tentatively titled &quot;The World Embedded in Modern Chinese Literary Imagination.&quot;

        Founded in 1840 following a rift between partners of Russell &amp;amp; Co., Augustine Heard &amp;amp; Co. rapidly became the second largest American trading firm in China. The firm expanded operations throughout China’s treaty ports, its partners witnessing first-hand many of the defining moments of Sino-Western contact during the nineteenth century. But by 1876 the firm had failed, the Heard brothers retreating from China to pursue new interests in Europe in the United States. Still, in the course of their enterprise, the brothers generated a massive amount of material describing life and commerce on the China coast. Applying an innovative global-microhistorial approach to the history of the firm’s partners, my research uses the case study of this company to explore the ways American merchants were shaped by their experiences living and trading within both the British and Qing empires. It in turn explores the various ways these merchants were active participants in Britain’s imperial project in China.

        The sudden emergence of Su Shi’s Old Tree, Rock, and Bamboo into the public light a few years past provided a rare opportunity to examine closely this famous scroll that includes Su Shi’s painting and Mi Fu’s calligraphy. With the focus on the scroll’s authenticity, there was renewed interest and disagreement regarding the scroll’s seals. In this lecture, it will be demonstrated that further examination of the seals leads to a rare opportunity to reconstruct not only the later history of this famous scroll containing Su’s and Mi’s “twin treasures,” but rare insight into the scroll’s making and reception.

        The Great Exodusexamines one of the least understood forced migrations in modern East Asia—the human exodus from China to Taiwan following the Nationalist collapse and Chinese Communist victory in 1949. Peeling back layers of Cold War ideological constructs, the book tells a very different story from conventional historiographies the Chinese civil war, Chinese revolution, and Cold War Taiwan. Underscoring the displaced population’s trauma of living in exile and their poignant “homecomings” four decades later, Yang presents a multiple-event trajectory of repeated traumatization with the recurring search for home, belonging, and identity. By portraying the Chinese civil war exiles in Taiwan both as traumatized subjects of displacement and overbearing colonizers to the local peoples, this thought-provoking work challenges the established notions of trauma, memory production, diaspora, and reconciliation. It speaks to the importance of subject position, boundary-crossing empathic unsettlements, and ethical responsibility of researching, narrating, and representing historical trauma.

        With the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party faced a major dilemma: How to obtain useful information, when public debates are massively restricted and loyalty counts for more than competence? To deal with the problem of information distortion, the CCP developed a two-pronged approach: Besides public news items that catered towards mobilizational aspects, it established distinct systems of feedback loops, which were strictly tasked to separate facts from opinion in order to provide the party leadership with an objective account of domestic and international events. Over time, a distinct system for controlled circulation of intelligence, an “information order”, took shape, which remained in place until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution. Despite major disruptions, the system’s basic structures were kept alive even throughout these tumultuous years and continue to impact the CCP’s information politics until the present.

This event is the first of four parts for WEAI's Asia in Action workshop series,&quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC.&quot;

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

This talk examines citizen scoring in and public support for China’s Social Credit System (SCS). Dr. Fan analyzed the mechanism of credit scoring embedded in the SCS and show two facets of the SCS: a normative apparatus fostering “good” citizens and a regulative apparatus normalizing “deviant” behaviors. He also used a survey experiment to test how types of monitored behaviors and different information exposure explain public support for the SCS. The findings suggest that citizens are more likely to support monitoring financial behaviors. More importantly, exposure to Western media increases public support for monitoring non-financial behaviors in the SCS. Fan Liang (PhD, University of Michigan) is an Assistant Professor of Media at Duke Kunshan University. His research examines how new communication technologies construct social and political changes, and how social and political powers shape and regulate the design and operation of such technologies.

        Join us on the 232rd anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's death on April 12, 1790 to see what came of his last bet—a gift of 2,000 pounds to Boston and Philadelphia, to be lent out to tradesmen over the next two centuries to jump‑start their careers. Each loan would be repaid with interest over ten years. If all went according to Franklin’s inventive scheme, the accrued final payout in 1991 would be a windfall.

InBenjamin Franklin’s Last Bet, Michael Meyer traces the evolution of these twin funds as they age alongside America itself, bankrolling woodworkers and silversmiths, trade schools and space races. Over time, Franklin’s wager was misused, neglected, and contested—but never wholly extinguished. With charm and inquisitive flair, Meyer shows how Franklin’s stake in the “leather-apron” class remains in play to this day, and offers an inspiring blueprint for prosperity in our modern era of growing wealth disparity and social divisions.

        People tend to think of decolonization in Asia as being a phenomenon of the Cold War Era, where European colonizers, having survived humiliating blows of Japanese occupation of their Asian colonies during the Second World War, reluctantly but unavoidably relinquished their suzerainty and allowed numerous new nation-states to emerge in the Asia-Pacific through the first three decades of the postwar period.

In reality, the South China Sea and its surrounding political entities have always been a realm of influence of a superpower external to the region; the British Empire during the Colonial Era and the US through much of the latter half of the 20thcentury. No sooner US influence started to recede with the conclusion of the Cold War, than South China Sea starts to experience the hegemonic encroachment of rising China. Taiwan feels the heat of increasing PRC pressure upon her precarious independent status in the global arena, while Hong Kong’s freedom once guaranteed by the Basic Law and the ‘1 country 2 systems’ principle has been continuously and methodically dismantled from the earliest years of Xi Jinping’s presidency. The democratizing trend of Southeast Asia has suffered similar setbacks, with Thailand and Myanmar reverting back to military rule and returning to draconian measures to suppress pro-democracy protesters.

The online pro-democracy network known as the ‘Milk Tea Alliance,’ which emerged in April 2020, among netizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, is the first online movement to vocalize what has been a long standing yet unspeakable suspicion among the younger generation of this region—that the Chinese Communist Government is a mutual obstacle for democratization of the Asia-Pacific. For the first time in history, the fight for Taiwan independence, Hong Kong’s freedom, and Thailand and Myanmar’s democratization becomes one and the same, united by the superpower threat against democracy and human rights in the form of PRC influence across the region. The ‘Milk Tea Alliance’ quest for freedom is the last of the unfinished business from the colonial era. It is the long overdue last wave of decolonization in Asia.

        Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia has increased dramatically since 2013 when the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was announced. The dominant investments have been in infrastructure development, power plant construction and mineral extraction and processing. In a recent collaboration with the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, the Research Center for Climate Change at the University of Indonesia (RCCC-UI) conducted a spatial environmental assessment of 14 clusters of BRI projects throughout Indonesia. The research project seeks to understand the environmental and social impacts of the projects by focusing on a project’s distance from primary forest, trends of vegetation and carbon loss, emission of nitrous oxide (NOx) as a dangerous air pollutant, the presence of selected endangered species and the presence of affected Indigenous Peoples.

Join us on Wednesday, April 20, for a discussion on the spatial environmental assessment of select BRI projects in Indonesia, featuring Rebecca Ray and University of Indonesia researchers Albertus Hadi Pramono, Masita Dwi Mandini Manessa, Mochamad Indrawan and Dwi Amalia Sari. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        This lecture explores the life of an elite woman, raised in Beijing and educated at a missionary school during the May Fourth era. Daughter of a Beiyang reformer, wife of a Nationalist official educated at MIT, mother of an underground Communist revolutionary, she herself left no direct trace in the public record. She emerges primarily in interviews with her son, and in an unfinished and unpublished historical novel by her daughter. Filial love, household management, sexual propriety, wifely duty, maternal loyalty, domestic cosmopolitanism, and shrewd political judgment mingle in her story, raising questions about where revolution lies and how we should track its less visible effects. Her life illuminates the gendered effects of China’s long revolution, the central importance of women as symbols of the nation, and the limits of what we can know about the past.

Gail Hershatter, Research Professor and Distinguished Professor Emer. of History at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

        China has become deeply integrated in the world economy, yet gradual marketization has facilitated the country’s rise without a wholesale assimilation to global neoliberalism. In her new book, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy: The Market Reform Debate,” Isabella Weber uncovers the fierce contest for economic reforms that shaped China’s path. In the first post-Mao decade, reformers were sharply divided: should China destroy the core of the socialist system through shock therapy, or should it use the institutions of the planned economy as market creators? With hindsight, the historical record proves the high stakes behind the question: China embarked on an economic expansion commonly described as unprecedented in scope and pace, whereas Russia’s economy collapsed under shock therapy.

Based on extensive research, including interviews with key Chinese and international participants and World Bank officials as well as insights gleaned from unpublished documents, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy” charts the debate that ultimately enabled China to follow a path to gradual reindustrialization. Beyond shedding light on the crossroads of the 1980s, it reveals the intellectual foundations of state-market relations in reform-era China through a longue durée lens. Overall, the book delivers an original perspective on China’s economic model and its continuing contestations from within and from without.

Join us on Thursday, April 21, for a discussion with Isabella Weber, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, on her new book and China’s path of economic reform. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global Economic Governance Book Talk Series.

        For our April book club we’re reading Joan Is Okay in preparation for our chat with the author, Weike Wang. --- Joan is a thirty-something ICU doctor at a busy New York City hospital. The daughter of Chinese parents who came to the United States to secure the American dream for their children, Joan is intensely devoted to her work, happily solitary, successful. She does look up sometimes and wonder where her true roots lie: at the hospital, where her white coat makes her feel needed, or with her family, who try to shape her life by their own cultural and social expectations.

Join us on the 232rd anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's death on April 12, 1790 to see what came of his last bet—a gift of 2,000 pounds to Boston and Philadelphia, to be lent out to tradesmen over the next two centuries to jump‑start their careers. Each loan would be repaid with interest over ten years. If all went according to Franklin’s inventive scheme, the accrued final payout in 1991 would be a windfall.

InBenjamin Franklin’s Last Bet, Michael Meyer traces the evolution of these twin funds as they age alongside America itself, bankrolling woodworkers and silversmiths, trade schools and space races. Over time, Franklin’s wager was misused, neglected, and contested—but never wholly extinguished. With charm and inquisitive flair, Meyer shows how Franklin’s stake in the “leather-apron” class remains in play to this day, and offers an inspiring blueprint for prosperity in our modern era of growing wealth disparity and social divisions.

        Digitization facilitates censorship in Chinese archives, but it also gives us new tools to study censorship and to renew the historian's craft. This talk explores the opportunities and challenges of studying twentieth-century Chinese history in the digital age. Drawing on archival statistics and metadata from several provincial collections, it begins by taking stock of the archival landscape in contemporary China: What has been made available (and not?). It then applies the latest digital methods to query the genre of &quot;nianpu&quot; (chronicles) in the Chinese Communist Party historiography. Using techniques such as named entity recognition and network analysis, it reveals internal connections and textual discrepancies to raise new questions about elite politics and political communication in Mao's China. The talk will end with ideas for digital study of modern Chinese history and practical suggestions for research data management in the age of information overload and official surveillance.

This event is the third in a four-part Asia in Action workshop series,&quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC&quot; at WEAI.

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

The next and last event is:

        Chinese food has been at the center of increasing anti-Chinese (Asian) sentiment since the advent of COVID-19. As the exceptionally high rate of Chinese takeout restaurants forced to close in 2020 indicates, the pandemic has reinforced a long-held racist view of Chinese food as unhealthy and unhygienic. This panel addresses how we can help to solve this problem by incorporating cooking and eating as a critical teaching component in Asian and Asian-American history classes. More specifically, it will ask what kinds of teaching methods we can experiment with when approaching food (arguably one of the most engaging themes) as an historical subject. It will also explore how we can encourage students to ask critical questions regarding Chinese food in terms of its consumption and production in order for them to appreciate the unlikely interplay of food and racial politics. Finally, it will address how the hands-on experience of cooking, which includes grocery shopping and recipe research as well as eating and sharing, can serve as a powerful teaching tool for promoting such values as diversity, inclusion, and respect in a pandemic era. Two speakers will present on their experience of teaching on this theme, which will be followed by a discussion with the audience.

This event will take place as part of WEAI’s ongoing series, “Asia in Action: Knowledge and Inclusion in a Time of Fear and Ignorance.”

        Policemen served a pivotal role in the politics of the Mao era, yet we know little about these important historical actors. Wang's paper draws upon rich archival records of police work reports to county authorities in western China from 1949 and 1963 to examine everyday practices of policing. In particular, Wang looks at the reported operation of a county police department in dealing with population movement and household registrations, which served as foundations for executing policies related to social order, political prosecution, and economic redistribution. Wang's paper analyzes these police reports with a focus on the language used, the venue and manner in which investigations were conducted, and explanations for conclusions reached. In doing so, this research sheds light on the close connections between investigative methods, the making of bureaucrats, and narrative construction as a practice of policing.

        Rapid coastal development presents substantial risks to marine habitats, biodiversity and coastal communities dependent upon vital marine ecosystem services. Noting that China is now the world’s largest bilateral creditor of overseas development finance, Blake Alexander Simmons, Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources at Colorado State University, will present a new study investigating the extent to which coastal development projects financed by Chinese development finance institutions present both direct and indirect risks to marine habitats, threatened species, marine protected areas and coastal Indigenous communities. Simmons will discuss where risks are greatest and how this knowledge can be used to create an agenda for “blue-ing” China’s overseas development finance portfolio.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.

        Chinese social life is saturated with interactions with entities other than living humans – ancestors, suffering souls, gods, animal spirits… A wide repertoire of ritual techniques regulates these interactions; some of them, aim at limiting those with dangerous entities, but this talk is interested in those that instead aim at cultivating mutually beneficial relationships. By exploring both narrative and ritual sources from the modern era (16th-20th century), we will see that these ritual techniques promote a process of subjectivation in both humans and non-humans. It is as subjects that humans and their usually invisible interlocutors can form bonds and social networks. We will see, through the case of spirit-writing cults, how Social Network Analysis (SNA) extended to spirits allows us to think afresh the question of the status of non-humans in China and beyond.
