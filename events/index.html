        China’s influential role in international affairs has been facilitated by China’s membership in multilateral institutions (UN/UNSC, IMF, World Bank, GATT/WTO) created after the Second World War. This has not precluded China’s more recent initiatives in creating new international institutions headquartered in China like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). While the PRC’s actions within global governance structures have been increasingly used to assert its strategic interests, the creation of international structures headquartered in China provides it with a “safety net” to pursue its core multilateral objectives in the Eurasian region. How will these two dimensions influence China’s navigation of an increasingly fractured multilateral global governance system?

        Join UW-TSP on Wednesday, February 7 at 3:30pm in THO 317 and onlineas we welcome Professor Ian Rowen to discuss his newly published bookOne China, Many Taiwans: The Geopolitics of Cross-Strait Tourism.One China, Many Taiwans examines how tourism, one of several strategies employed by the PRC at exerting political control over Taiwan, aggravated tensions between the two polities, polarized Taiwanese society, and pushed Taiwanese popular sentiment further toward support for national self-determination.

Professor Rowen will focus on how Chinese tourism bifurcated Taiwan into “Two Taiwans”—one performed as a part of China for Chinese group tourists, versus the other experienced as a site of everyday life by local residents and some independent tourists. He will also delve into how this process amplified conflict between those business, civil society, and state actors that had a differing interest in sustaining a PRC-oriented tourist industry, creating an increasingly pluralistic civic nationalism in Taiwan.

Ian Rowenis Associate Professor in the Department of Taiwan Culture, Languages and Literature at National Taiwan Normal University. Previously an assistant professor of Geography and Sociology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he earned his PhD in Geography from the University of Colorado at Boulder.

This event was made possible by the generous support of the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.

        日本研究东亚近代法史具有重要的意义。首先，可以为自己的国家提供立法或解释的参照材料。日本在飞鸟时代到明治初期将中国法作为研究中心，并运用于其立法和解释。其次，研究外国法有助于外交、交易或调整家族关系的需要。此外，通过法律制度可以深入了解外国的社会文化。
本讲座试图概观近代法史，尝试将东亚（包括东南亚在内）近代时期划分为条约时期、万国公法时期（或一般国际法时期）、全面引进西方法制时期(继受或移植的时期）以及修改不平等条约后时期，阐述每个划分阶段代表国家的政策法律、具有代表性的法学者或政治人物、进而比较东亚近代法史。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道收看讲座。

        The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), ten years since it began, has become China’s guiding foreign engagement and economic governance principle in the Xi Jinping era. However, questions remain — with regards to their implementation, why do megaprojects encounter such divergent responses — with some gaining local support while others causing local grievances? This paper addresses these questions by conducting sub-national level analysis and by applying the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) in tracing the rise and fall of economic-centered coalitions in the Kenyan Standard Gauge Railway project, one of the most controversial and influential China-financed megaprojects of the BRI. The paper is part of a book project on the impact of Chinese-led infrastructure megaprojects in the Global South. Our research is based on fieldwork in China and Kenya between 2015 and 2023, and we conducted over 300 surveys and interviews with stakeholders involved with BRI project development and community-based project impact assessment. Our findings suggest that the BRI developed its current form from China’s domestic experience driven by economic interests, which laid the foundation for economic-centered coalitions that contributed to progress during project construction. Yet. such coalitions fluctuated with interest redistribution, which changed project outcomes, and led to future uncertainties in project development and Initiative success. The research project fills the gap in existing literature by providing a sub-national perspective on the impact of Chinese overseas engagement and provides a new pathway for assessing China’s growing sphere of influence.

        We examine whether the spread of Protestantism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had a persistent impact on China’s recent economic growth and, if it did, what mechanisms were involved. Combining China’s county-level data on Protestant density before 1920 and socioeconomic indicators in 2000, we find persistent positive effects of historical missionary activities on contemporary growth. We further find that although improvements in education and health care account for a sizable portion of the total effects, other channels such as transformed social values may also matter. To quantify this mechanism, we use the data of Chinese industrial firms during 1999–2007 and find that the intensity of Protestant activities in 1920 significantly reduced the extent of corporate tax avoidance among. Further analyses of a survey-based dataset and a proprietary peer-to-peer lending dataset show that Protestantism fostered social capital that persists in the long run. The Protestant missionaries started the trend to educate women in the 19th century China, paving Chinese women’s way into higher education and professional services. Using a hand-collected dataset of college students from 1928-1938, we show that the Protestant missions improved gender equality in higher education. Furthermore, the increase in educational attainment led to a higher number of female doctors and civil servants in the short run and a higher gender ratio in skilled occupations in the long run.

        The 2021 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games were initially seen as a testament to resilience as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But this image was sullied by subsequent allegations of widespread bribery and price-fixing involving a director of the Organizing Committee, major sponsors, and contractors. Professor Masayuki Tamaruyaof the University of Tokyo will discuss why international sports financing so often produces corruption scandals, perennial challenges in both international and domestic sports governance, and Japan’s efforts to improve transparency and compliance in its own sports federations and university sports – with mixed results.

Three members of the USHCA's leadership had the honor to be invited to a small &quot;old friends&quot; reception to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco on November 18, 2023, the same day that President Biden and President Xi met on the sidelines of the APEC meetings. Following that small gathering, the USHCA representatives then joined close to 200 guests from around the U.S. to attend an exclusive dinner at which President Xi delivered a significant speech in which he shared China's openness to cooperation and posed a crucial question: &quot;Are we partners or are we adversaries?&quot;

The Biden-Xi meeting and the special reception and dinner on that day have led to many recent positive developments in US-China relations. In this webinar, Susan Thornton, USHCA Vice-Chair, and one of the leading American experts on China, will lead a discussion about the 2024 prospects for U.S.-China ties based on their take-aways from the San Francisco meetings and their other interactions with U.S. and Chinese counterparts.

        Much of the US-China strategic rivalry in the last few years has played out as a struggle for technological supremacy. The Trump years were characterized by an unabashed abandonment of the discourse of free trade and international cooperation in favour of the language of “decoupling” and nationalism. This was accompanied by tariffs, import bans, and export controls, including pressure on non-US companies to adhere to US law, and was met with retaliatory measures from China. While the strident discourse between the two countries has seen ebbs and flows, the ongoing friction around technology access has had far reaching consequences. This panel aims to understand the direct and also indirect effects of the ongoing technology battles between the US and China. It is part of an ongoing series of panels organized by the India China Institute on emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older international order that used to be dominated by US leadership. Some of the issues that this panel will explore include: the impacts on companies which have had to “China-proof” or “US-proof” their operations; the redirecting of investments and shifting away of manufacturing away from China to other parts of the world; new geographies of technological innovation that include battles for supremacy in AI, biotech, smart cities, and climate change technologies; the impact on academic networks and flows of students and experts; and finally geopolitical consequences as governments have had to take sides in new infrastructural, technological and military alliances.

        Abstract: From the perspective of the maritime borderlands centered on the island of Tsushima, late medieval Japanese transformations in commercialization, local lordship, and the integration of the archipelago into domestic and East Asian shipping circuits all depended on flows of enslaved peoples. The history of Tsushima’s trafficking networks between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries helps explain the persistence of slavery in late medieval Japan by revealing motivations of traffickers. Slaving empowered cooperation among a cross-section of Tsushima society to form piracy enterprises (Ch.wokou,Kn.waegu, Jp.kaizoku). Lords of the island, the Sō family, integrated slavery into the administrative machinery of their territorial domain and incentivized military service with awards tied to trafficking. They shaped medieval discoursesof status and ethnicity that facilitated the objectification of captives into commodified “baseborn” (genin) and “exotics” (Tōjin) from China and the Korean peninsula, who Tsushima traffickers dealt locally and across the archipelago, including to the apex of the warrior hierarchy, the Ashikaga shogunate.For retainers, local elites, and commoner mariners, such sanctioned trafficking became a source of prestige and family legacies alongside othercommercial and violent enterprises. Incentivized by the promise of tax exemptions and other awards from the Sō, their piratical enterprisesraided Korean and Chinese coasts and engaged in military campaigns in Kyushu. Territorial bestowals across northern Kyushu turned sea-lanes into slave roads. This history invites reconsideration of trafficking in medieval Japan as a low-status, opportunistic, and declining trade.

        International negotiations about climate change have long been anchored in frameworks of carbon emissions and net-zero targets. However, this framing has not necessarily captured the most meaningful goals for many parts of the world that are coping with some of the most intense effects of climate change. Their concerns have centered around other issues such as the availability of water, the rise in extreme heat, air pollution, and shifts in patterns of biodiversity and agriculture. These issues are undoubtedly connected to emissions, and yet the dominant framework has often determined the production of knowledge, the determination of targets, and the design of interventions, in ways that have elided the concerns of different parts of the world. This panel will bring together scholars and practitioners from the Global South who will discuss the perspectives of climate change that are most trenchant in their parts of the world.

The panel is part of an ongoing series organized by the India China institute on emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older putatively liberal international order dominated by US leadership. By focusing on alternative frameworks, it seeks to broaden and make more representative differing ways of understanding and addressing climate change.

        The project 'Regionalizing Infrastructures in Chinese History' invites scholars of Chinese and European archaeology and history to participate in the international workshop 'Perspectives on the Materiality of City Walls in China and Europe'. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different archaeological contexts to share best practices in the analysis of archaeological knowledge production, to identify key issues within existing practices, and to explore approaches to materiality in archaeology by examining case studies from various geographical areas and historical eras.

Participants are invited to submit preliminary position papers (up to 5 pages) which will be discussed during the two sessions. Travel for participants will be covered within Europe.

Panel 1:Archaeological reporting(10.00 - 12.30)

How researchers engage with the materiality of city walls, the capacity of those walls to modify the perception and action of humans, depends often on local approaches to the material. On one hand, archeological reports serve as a starting point for reconstructing archaeological knowledge-making processes in different locations and, by extension, for discerning theoretical trends and dominant ideas in archaeological science. On the other hand, archaeology is notorious for the amount of gray literature it creates. How do we facilitate access to this information as archaeologists? How do we extract meaningful data from them?

The reports, both published and unpublished, create opportunities to discuss methodological approaches, different frameworks, as well as blind spots of archaeological reporting. This panel invites researchers to examine how the materiality of city walls shape the perception and action of archaeologists, policymakers, and others who engage with the material remains of city walls in the present by addressing, among others, the following questions:

● Are there local, regional, and national trends in archaeological research on city walls (and infrastructure in general)?

● Are city walls a priority in choosing sites? Are certain time periods given priority?

● Is research on city walls only driven from above (i.e. by new infrastructure development and state-sponsored tourism), or does some of it come from below?

● Can digital technologies facilitate local, regional, and global comparative investigations of material remains of city walls?

Panel 2:Materiality and communication(14.00-17.00)

Andrea Mubi Brighenti and Mattias Kärrhold, in their introduction toUrban Walls: Political and Cultural Meanings of Vertical Structures and Surfaces(2018),refer to walls asmaterial and semiotic technologies of inter- visibility managementand walling as atechnology of social interaction. In archaeological interpretations, city walls delineate ingroups and outgroups; they demonstrate seemingly clear borders between past and present regimes. In recent years the renewed interest in city walls as tourist attractions has made it so that city walls everywhere are treated as local/national symbols. City walls create bonds and barriers to this day; they are sources of safety and alienation, and in recent years walls are a source of revenue through tourism. They also influence city planning and community relations. This panel explores how city walls create social relations by examining, among others, the following questions:

● How are memories of city walls transmitted? What is the role of city walls in inculcating culture (generatinghabitus)?

        The concept of Hygienic Modernity has been proposed for about 20 years. This talk takes the Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) poisoning event in Taiwan in the Cold War period as an example to revisit this well-known concept in the modern history of East Asia. The PCBs are incurable industrial toxicants and have caused environmental pollution and food poisoning from the U.S. to East Asia since the 1970s. I argue that this pollution in Taiwan was a transformative point when industrial toxicants became modern hygienic issues, and the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine treatments for PCBs became a new kind of modernity in the 1980s. Moreover, the Kuomintang (KMT) government constructed this integrated therapeutic method to tackle the hygienic and societal disorders caused by Western industrial modernity.

In the late period of the Cold War, difficult political situations at home and abroad posed the KMT government with numerous social movements in Taiwan. During the outbreak of PCBs poisonings and the following grassroots consumerism campaigns, Li-Fu Chen, an influential KMT politician, promoted the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine for PCBs therapy beneath the official propaganda of the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Movement (1966-1991). Interdisciplinary teams conducted both animal experiments and clinical trials to validate the therapeutic effectiveness of this project. Although the long-term outcome of Chinese medicine treatment was unsatisfactory, this project benefited the KMT government’s three political goals: alleviated societal panic, propagated Taiwan’s medical achievements to the West, and institutionalized the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine.
