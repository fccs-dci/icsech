        In 2015, China issued a Defence White Paper that categorically stated that “the strategic concept of active defense is the essence of the CPC’s military strategic thought” - lifting the veil over China’s military strategy. However, what remains unclear is how defensive is the concept of active defence? ‘Active defence’ calls for the People’s Liberation Army to ‘not attack unless attacked, but surely counterattack when attacked’. Therefore, one cannot ignore the scope or potential of ‘pre-emption’ in the case of China. Simply put, Beijing’s growing military capabilities and quest for power projection suggest an ‘offensive’ intent—an ability to attack and not just respond when attacked. As noted, in the form of recent Chinese military activism in the Taiwan Straits against US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August. In this context, it becomes imperative to decode the underpinnings of ‘active defence’ in China’s Military Strategy.

        The history of pre-Qin Classical Chinese thought is usually woven around a small set of great philosophers, each taken as the authorial voice behind a single text: Kongzi (the Lunyu), Laozi (Daodejing), Mozi, Mengzi, Zhuangzi (the “Inner Chapters” of the Zhuangzi), Xunzi, and Hanfeizi. Does this view of texts and authors fit the reality of how texts were written and formed in early China? Based on archeological evidence from recently excavated texts and greater attention to the role of Han dynasty scholars in editing and forming texts, many scholars of early China have argued that it does not. In this faculty dialogue, Tao Jiang, Esther Sunkyung Klein, and Franklin Perkins will explore the implications of that conclusion for how we should read and interpret classical Chinese philosophical texts. 

Tao Jiang is Professor of Chinese and Buddhist Philosophies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. He is the author ofOrigins of Moral-Political Philosophy in Early China(Oxford 2021) andContexts and Dialogue: Yogācāra Buddhism and Modern Psychology on the Subliminal Mind(Hawaii 2006). Jiang is chair of Religion Department and director of Center for Chinese Studies at Rutgers.

Esther Sunkyung Klein (PhD Princeton, East Asian Studies 2010) is Senior Lecturer at The Australian National University. She researches pre-modern Chinese thought, including both the philosophical and historical traditions. She has published on the authorship of theZhuangzi, ideas of the historian as author in relation to theShiji,epistemology in Han dynasty thought.

Franklin Perkins is Professor of Philosophy at UHM and editor of the journal Philosophy East and West. His main research interests are in classical Chinese philosophy, early modern European philosophy, and in the challenges of doing philosophy in a comparative or intercultural context.

About the event

The U.S.-Asia Law Institute holds the Gelatt Dialogue every year with a different theme but the same broad goal: to foster connection and improve understanding among the legal communities in Asia and the United States. Recent developments in the United States and Asia make this a good time to examine the state of women’s rights protection, with a particular focus on the interplay between domestic and international law and norms.The dialogue is co-sponsored by the Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Network at NYU Law.



Agenda:


	
	Opening Remarks - 9:00 AM - 9:10 AM US Eastern Time
	
	
	Panel 1: Whither Reproductive Rights? - 9:10 AM - 10:50 AM US Eastern Time

	
		
		The rise of right-wing politics in the United States and demographic trends in Asia are causing rapid shifts in longstanding assumptions in many countries about access to contraceptives and abortion. In the United States, the impetus for change comes from a socially conservative Supreme Court and state governments that oppose abortions. In some Asian countries, concern about low fertility and aging societies is the trigger. Can reproductive rights and justice be advanced through population policies?
		
		
		Speakers:

		
			
			Keynote (and panelist): Chen Chao-ju, global professor of law at NYU School of Law; director of the Center for Human Rights and Jurisprudence at National Taiwan University College of Law; director of the Women’s and Gender Studies program at National Taiwan University. 15 min
			
			
			Melissa Murray, Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law at NYU and faculty director, Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Network. 15 min
			
			
			Feng Yuan (remote), visiting scholar, University of Hong Kong; co-founder of Equality (Beijing), an NGO; founding member of the Anti-Domestic Violence Network. 15 min
			
			
			Benjamin Liebman, visiting professor of law at NYU School of Law, and Molly Bodurtha of Columbia Law School. 15 min
			
			
			Moderator: Sylvia Law, Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of Law, Medicine, and Psychiatry Emerita at NYU School of Law. 
			
		
		
	
	
	
	Panel 2: The Role of International Law and Norms - 11:00 AM - 12:40 PM US Eastern Time

	
		
		This panel will examine broadly the role that international hard law and soft norms have historically played in advancing women’s rights in Asia, with particular attention to the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its Committee. What is the future of UN forums providing a “second look” at national laws, judicial decisions, and practices at a time of considerable backlash against the entire UN human rights system? 

		
			
			Speakers:

			
				Masako Mori (pre-recorded), special advisor to the Japanese prime minister for women’s empowerment, former minister of justice of Japan. 15 min
				Rangita de Silva de Alwis, member-elect to CEDAW Treaty Body Expert Committee; associate dean of International Affairs and academic director of the Global Institute for Human Rights at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. 15 min
				Carole Petersen, professor, University of Hawaii School of Law.  15 min 
				Vasuki Nesiah, professor of human rights and international law, The Gallatin School, NYU 15 min
				Moderator: Jose E. Alvarez, Herbert and Rose Rubin Professor of International Law, NYU. 
			
			
		
		
	
	
	
	Lunch break - 12:40 PM - 1:50 PM US Eastern Time (Boxed Lunches will be available for those attending in-person, please RSVP)
	
	
	Panel 3: Asian Feminism and The Transnational Women’s Movement - 1:50 PM - 3:30 PM US Eastern Time

	
		
		This panel will extend the discussion in panel 2 to examine the interplay between the transnational women’s movement and domestic Asian women’s movements. Asian feminists have simultaneously been inspired and supported by the transnational movement, pushed back against “Western liberal feminists” to set their own goals, and contributed their own ideas about which rights should be prioritized. What is the main direction of influence now, and what new trends can we identify?

        在顾维钧从事外交活动的时代，中国通常是以弱国身份与列强打交道的。这一境况十分考验中国外交尤其是外交官的应对。弱国有无外交？弱国如何外交？这是民国年间中国面对列强的一大问题。顾维钧对中国的国力有清醒的认识，承认弱国这一事实，但在与列强交涉时，有理有节，不自卑更不胆怯，为国家争权益也赢得尊重。弱国外交的应对不仅仅要处理与列强打交道的问题，还要面对国内民众的要求和呼声，这同样考验外交官的智慧和勇气，也影响中国与外部世界的关系。本次讲座将通过顾维钧与巴黎和会、国联、中英新约谈判和旧金山会议等具体事例展现并讨论他的外交应对之道。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道，观看本次讲座。

Russia’s actions in Ukraine have raised questions about the future of the United Nations (UN). Many UN members have supported US-led efforts to impose sanctions on Russia, to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, to suspend Russia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council, and to establish a UN Commission to investigate alleged war crimes in Ukraine. However, two formidable states, namely China and India, have been among the ones resisting the need to “take sides” in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. At a time when the capacity for effective UN Security Council responses, even in response to aggression, seems stymied, how should we understand the posture of China and India in response to Ukraine and other formidable global challenges, including climate change? This is the rare opportunity to engage in conversation with a leading UN insider – at a time when the UN faces what some consider to be an “existential crisis.”

BOOK TALK BY SUSAN SHIRK

FOR THREE DECADES AFTER MAO’S DEATH IN 1976, CHINA’S LEADERS ADOPTED A RESTRAINED APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY. TO FACILITATE THE COUNTRY’S INEXORABLE ECONOMIC ASCENDENCE, AND TO PREVENT A BACKLASH, THEY REASSURED THE OUTSIDE WORLD OF CHINA’S PEACEFUL INTENTIONS.

THEN, AS SUSAN SHIRK SHOWS IN THIS ILLUMINATING, SOBERING, AND UTTERLY REFRESHING NEW BOOK, SOMETHING CHANGED. CHINA WENT FROM FRAGILE SUPERPOWER TO GLOBAL HEAVYWEIGHT, MUSCLING ITS WAY AROUND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, PUNISHING COUNTRIES THAT DISAGREE WITH CHINA, INTIMIDATING TAIWAN, TIGHTENING ITS GRIP ON HONG KONG, AND OPENLY CHALLENGING THE UNITED STATES FOR PREEMINENCE NOT JUST ECONOMICALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY BUT MILITARILY. CHINA BEGAN TO OVERREACH. 

COMBINING HER DECADES OF RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE, SHIRK, AUTHOR OF THE HUGELY INFLUENTIAL CHINA: FRAGILE SUPERPOWER, ARGUES THAT WE ARE NOW FULLY EMBROILED IN A NEW COLD WAR.

PRYING OPEN THE &quot;BLACK BOX&quot; OF CHINA’S POLITICAL SYSTEM, SHIRK SHOWS THE SHIFT TOWARD CONFRONTATION BEGAN IN THE MID-2000S UNDER THE MILD-MANNERED HU JINTAO. AS CHINA’S ECONOMY BOOMED, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008, HU AND THE OTHER LEADERS LOST RESTRAINT, ABETTING AGGRESSION TOWARD THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND UNCHECKED DOMESTIC SOCIAL CONTROL. WHEN XI JINPING TOOK POWER IN 2012, HE CAPITALIZED ON WIDESPREAD OFFICIAL CORRUPTION AND OPEN SPLITS IN THE LEADERSHIP TO MAKE THE CASE FOR MORE CONCENTRATED POWER AT THE TOP.

IN THE DECADE FOLLOWING, AND TO THE PRESENT DAY, XI HAS ACCUMULATED GREATER POWER THAN ANY LEADER SINCE MAO. THOSE WHO IMPLEMENT XI’S DIRECTIVES COMPETE TO OUTDO ONE ANOTHER IN FERVOR, PROVOKING AN EVEN GREATER GLOBAL BACKLASH AND STOKING JINGOISM WITHIN CHINA ON A SCALE NOT SEEN SINCE THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. SHIRK’S EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS AND METICULOUS ANALYSIS REVEAL THE DYNAMICS DRIVING OVERREACH. TO COUNTER IT, SHE ARGUES, THE WORST MISTAKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND THE UNITED STATES IN PARTICULAR, CAN MAKE IS TO OVERREACT. UNDERSTANDING THE DOMESTIC ROOTS OF CHINA’S ACTIONS WILL ENABLE US TO AVOID THE MISTAKES THAT COULD LEAD TO WAR.

        Book Talk by Susan Shirk

For three decades after Mao’s death in 1976, China’s leaders adopted a restrained approach to foreign policy. To facilitate the country’s inexorable economic ascendence, and to prevent a backlash, they reassured the outside world of China’s peaceful intentions.

Then, as Susan Shirk shows in this illuminating, sobering, and utterly refreshing new book, something changed. China went from fragile superpower to global heavyweight, muscling its way around the South China Sea, punishing countries that disagree with China, intimidating Taiwan, tightening its grip on Hong Kong, and openly challenging the United States for preeminence not just economically and technologically but militarily. China began to overreach. 

Combining her decades of research and experience, Shirk, author of the hugely influential China: Fragile Superpower, argues that we are now fully embroiled in a new cold war.

Prying open the &quot;black box&quot; of China’s political system, Shirk shows the shift toward confrontation began in the mid-2000s under the mild-mannered Hu Jintao. As China’s economy boomed, especially after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, Hu and the other leaders lost restraint, abetting aggression toward the outside world and unchecked domestic social control. When Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he capitalized on widespread official corruption and open splits in the leadership to make the case for more concentrated power at the top.

In the decade following, and to the present day, Xi has accumulated greater power than any leader since Mao. Those who implement Xi’s directives compete to outdo one another in fervor, provoking an even greater global backlash and stoking jingoism within China on a scale not seen since the Cultural Revolution. Shirk’s extensive interviews and meticulous analysis reveal the dynamics driving overreach. To counter it, she argues, the worst mistake the rest of the world, and the United States in particular, can make is to overreact. Understanding the domestic roots of China’s actions will enable us to avoid the mistakes that could lead to war.

        UW's China Studies and Taiwan Studies Programs welcome Professor Zhuqing Li to discuss her newly published book,Daughters of the Flower Fragrant Garden. Li will share her journey in trying to understand and reconstruct the near-century-long-lives of her two maternal aunts. Accidentally separated when China split in 1949, the two sisters, new college graduates at the time, refused to submit to the random power of history and fought their way to the elite echelons of the societies on the two sides of divided China. One became a successful capitalist and a devout Christian in Taiwan and later in America, and the other became a celebrated OB/GYN doctor in China and a dedicated Communist. In the end, however, the valiant efforts that had brought them success proved inadequate in finding a true reconciliation at their reunion after 33 years of complete separation.

        Real estate has had a vast influence on China's economy. In particular, real estate has taken a massive role across China's financial system — accounting for an estimated 70 percent of Chinese households' assets, 30 percent of local governments’ revenues, and almost 30 percent of all outstanding bank loans before the pandemic. As China's real estate sector faces a sharp crisis, what are the implications for the financial system and the financial health of China's broader economy? What are China’s debt risks as real estate prices plateau or fall?

Please join experts on China's financial sector for this discussion. This event is the second in a series on China's real estate sector and its broader economic effects.

IN 1952, JOHN T. “JACK” DOWNEY, A TWENTY-THREE-YEAR-OLD CIA OFFICER FROM CONNECTICUT, WAS SHOT DOWN OVER MANCHURIA DURING THE KOREAN WAR. THE PILOTS DIED IN THE CRASH, BUT DOWNEY AND HIS PARTNER RICHARD “DICK” FECTEAU WERE CAPTURED BY THE CHINESE. FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS, THEY WERE HARSHLY INTERROGATED, PUT THROUGH SHOW TRIALS, HELD IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, PLACED IN REEDUCATION CAMPS, AND TOURED AROUND CHINA AS POLITICAL PAWNS. OTHER PRISONERS OF WAR CAME AND WENT, BUT DOWNEY AND FECTEAU’S RELEASE HINGED ON THE UNITED STATES ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR STATUS AS CIA ASSETS. NOT UNTIL NIXON’S VISIT TO CHINA DID SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS THAW ENOUGH TO SECURE FECTEAU’S RELEASE IN 1971 AND DOWNEY’S IN 1973.

LOST IN THE COLD WARIS THE NEVER-BEFORE-TOLD STORY OF DOWNEY’S DECADES AS A PRISONER OF WAR AND THE EFFORTS TO BRING HIM HOME. DOWNEY’S LIVELY AND GRIPPING MEMOIR—WRITTEN IN SECRET LATE IN LIFE—INTERWEAVES HORRORS AND DEPRIVATION WITH HUMOR AND THE ABSURDITIES OF CAPTIVITY. HE RECOUNTS HIS PRISON EXPERIENCES: FEARFUL INTERROGATIONS, PANTOMIME COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIS GUARDS, A 3,000-PAGE OVERSTUFFED CONFESSION DESIGNED TO CONFUSE HIS CAPTORS, AND POSING FOR “SHOW” PHOTOGRAPHS FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES. THROUGH THE EYES OF HIS CAPTORS AND DURING HIS TOURS AROUND CHINA, DOWNEY WATCHED THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD, THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, AND THE DRASTIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE MAO ERA. IN INTERSPERSED CHAPTERS, THOMAS J. CHRISTENSEN, AN EXPERT ON SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, EXPLORES THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICS OF THE COLD WAR AND TELLS THE STORY OF HOW DOWNEY AND FECTEAU’S FAMILIES, THE CIA, THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT, AND SUCCESSIVE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS WORKED TO SECURE THEIR RELEASE.

In 1952, John T. “Jack” Downey, a twenty-three-year-old CIA officer from Connecticut, was shot down over Manchuria during the Korean War. The pilots died in the crash, but Downey and his partner Richard “Dick” Fecteau were captured by the Chinese. For the next twenty years, they were harshly interrogated, put through show trials, held in solitary confinement, placed in reeducation camps, and toured around China as political pawns. Other prisoners of war came and went, but Downey and Fecteau’s release hinged on the United States acknowledging their status as CIA assets. Not until Nixon’s visit to China did Sino-American relations thaw enough to secure Fecteau’s release in 1971 and Downey’s in 1973.

Lost in the Cold Waris the never-before-told story of Downey’s decades as a prisoner of war and the efforts to bring him home. Downey’s lively and gripping memoir—written in secret late in life—interweaves horrors and deprivation with humor and the absurdities of captivity. He recounts his prison experiences: fearful interrogations, pantomime communications with his guards, a 3,000-page overstuffed confession designed to confuse his captors, and posing for “show” photographs for propaganda purposes. Through the eyes of his captors and during his tours around China, Downey watched the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and the drastic transformations of the Mao era. In interspersed chapters, Thomas J. Christensen, an expert on Sino-American relations, explores the international politics of the Cold War and tells the story of how Downey and Fecteau’s families, the CIA, the U.S. State Department, and successive presidential administrations worked to secure their release.

        The U.S.-China relationship continues to limp from pillar to post, even as the midpoint of the Biden administration’s term in office is fast approaching. The hoped-for détente between the two sides has been slow to arrive. President Biden has spent the better part of the past two years ‘investing, aligning and competing’ at home and abroad, attempting to shape the strategic environment around China. Pursuing avenues of cooperation with Beijing has been an afterthought, at best. For President Xi Jinping, his second term in office has encountered controversy from a foreign relations standpoint. The U.S.-China trade war kicked into full gear a few months after his 19th Party Congress investiture. Coping with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the effects of Washington’s technology embargoes, rather than a second round of win-win ‘reform and opening up’ exchanges with the United States, have been the defining features of his second term. Russia’s attack on Ukraine, furthermore, has added grist to the democracies v. autocracies framing of great power relations by the Biden administration.

As President Xi begins his third term in office, what are the Chinese leadership’s priorities vis-à-vis the United States and the Biden administration likely to be? Is there any merit to the claim that there is an implicit 2027 timeline to bring Taiwan to heel? Will the two sides restore high-level mil-mil communications and maritime CBMs that have been suspended by Speaker Pelosi’s visit? What does the composition of the new Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee signify to overseas observers from a political and policy standpoint? What is President Biden and President Xi expected to discuss when they (likely) gather for their first in-person meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders Summit in Bali later this November.

In its first 20 months in office, the Biden administration has barely been interested in breaking bread with China on trade and economic matters. Will this pattern change following the midterm elections, given that China was not among the top 5 political topics leading into the midterms? Can a Phase Two trade and investment deal be consummated by the two sides that could place a floor under the rash of technology embargoes and supply chain decoupling initiatives introduced by Washington? How will the supply chain resilience-related initiatives alter the future structure of advanced manufacturing industries in the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific region? Will 2023 throw up fresh perspectives in this regard?

To listen to these and other answers to pressing U.S.-China questions discussed by experts in the field, tune in to the ICAS Annual Conference on November 2, 2022!

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.

        China’s overseas economic activity is diversifying beyond official development finance from its two main policy banks, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China. Despite the array of various debt, equity and grant financing mechanisms China’s policy banks have at their disposal, separate multi-stakeholder funds have emerged that are increasing Chinese financing capacity for overseas development projects. Since the mid-2000s, Chinese public and private financing institutions have established specialized investment funds that primarily provide equity financing to sector and region-specific development projects. These 'Overseas Development Investment Funds' (ODIFs) are an increasingly mentioned feature of Chinese foreign direct investment and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) financing instruments. Drawing on forthcoming research, Oyintarelado (Tarela) Moses, Data Analyst and Database Manager for the Global China Initiative at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and Laura Gormley, Research Assistant to the Global China Initiative, will explore the unique features, financing capacity, policy implications and future potential of China’s ODIFs.

Join us on Tuesday, November 8, for a discussion on diversifying the BRI with China’s ODIFs. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        CHINA’S NEXT ACT: HOW SUSTAINABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY ARE RESHAPING CHINA
      </h3></div><div><p class="text-gray-800 text-sm">

        If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that the world is bound together by shared challenges—and that at the center of those challenges stands China. Thanks to decades of breakneck growth and development, Chinese officials, businesses, and institutions now play a critical role in every major global issue, from climate change to biotechnology. China’s Next Act re-envisions China’s role in the world in terms of sustainability and technology. This reframing is essential both because none of these increasingly pressing, shared global challenges can be tackled without China, and because they are reshaping China’s economy and its foreign policy, with major implications for the world at large. At the same time, sustainability and technology issues present opportunities for intensified economic, geopolitical, and ideological competition—a reality that Beijing recognizes.

The danger is that China’s next act will drive divergence on the rules and standards the world desperately needs to tackle shared challenges in the decades ahead. In some areas, like clean technology development, competition can be good for the planet. But in others, it could be catastrophic: only cooperation can lower the risks of artificial intelligence and other disruptive new technologies.

The challenges posed by climate change, pandemics, and emerging technologies make dealing with China’s state, its firms, and other institutions more complex and more critical than ever before. China’s Next Act helps foreign countries, companies, and other organizations prepare for a future shaped by sustainability, technology—and a dramatic new chapter for China and the world.

But literature is a universe with many centers, and one of them is China. The Making of Barbarians offers an account of world literature in which China, as center, produces its own margins. This book investigates the meanings of literary translation, adaptation, and appropriation on the boundaries of China long before it came into sustained contact with the West. Professor Saussy focuses on the period before 1850, when the translation of foreign works into Chinese was rare because Chinese literary tradition overshadowed those around it. This publication looks closely at literary works that were translated into Chinese from foreign languages or resulted from contact with alien peoples. It explores why translation was such an undervalued practice in premodern China, and how this vast and prestigious culture dealt with those outside it before a new group of foreigners—Europeans—appeared on the horizon.

        Today American institutions dominate nearly every major ranking of global universities. Yet in historical terms, America’s preeminence is relatively new, and there is no reason to assume that U.S. schools will continue to lead the world a century from now. Indeed, America’s supremacy in higher education is under great stress, particularly at its public universities. At the same time Chinese universities are on the ascent. Thirty years ago, Chinese institutions were reopening after the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution; today they are some of the most innovative educational centers in the world. Will China threaten American primacy?

Empires of Ideas looks to the past two hundred years for answers, chronicling two revolutions in higher education: the birth of the research university and its integration with the liberal education model. William C. Kirbyexamines the successes of leading universities—The University of Berlin and the Free University of Berlin in Germany; Harvard, Duke, and the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States—to determine how they rose to prominence and what threats they currently face. Kirby draws illuminating comparisons to the trajectories of three Chinese contenders: Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, and the University of Hong Kong, which aim to be world-class institutions that can compete with the best the United States and Europe have to offer. But Chinese institutions also face obstacles. Kirby analyzes the challenges that Chinese academic leaders must confront: reinvesting in undergraduate teaching, developing new models of funding, and navigating a political system that may undermine a true commitment to free inquiry and academic excellence.

In this MCI webinar, Prof. Kirby will delve deeper into the key points of his acclaimed book and participate in a Q&amp;amp;A session subsequent to the talk.

        A BIRD IN THE CAGE? PUBLIC COURT TRANSCRIPTS AND LITIGATION IN CHINA

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        Dr Bingchun Meng has written extensively about Chinese social media and its subjects. She provides a profound analysis of topics such as knowledge production, gender research and power structure, social science studies standpoints and academic awareness in different social contexts in China and the West. Her recent publication, The Politics of Chinese Media: Consensus and Contestation (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), offers an analytical account of the consensus and contestations of the politics of Chinese media at both institutional and discursive levels. It considers the formal politics of how the Chinese state manages political communication internally and externally in the post-socialist era, and examines the politics of news media, focusing particularly on how journalists navigate the competing demands of the state, the capital and the urban middle class readership. The book also addresses the politics of entertainment media, in terms of how power operates upon and within media culture, and the politics of digital networks, highlighting how the Internet has become the battlefield of ideological contestation while also shaping how political negotiations are conducted. Bearing in mind the contemporary relevance of China’s socialist revolution, this text challenges both the liberal universalist view that presupposes ‘the end of history’ and various versions of China exceptionalism, which downplay the impact of China’s integration into global capitalism.

        The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the public finances of African countries. It also led to rising debt levels in many African countries and has increased concerns about their ability to make their scheduled sovereign debt payments over the next few years. This looming debt crisis raises questions about how these countries can most effectively manage their debts and how their creditors can help them develop in sustainable and inclusive ways. Daniel Bradlow, SARCHI Professor of International Development Law and African Economic Relations at the University of Pretoria, and Magalie Masamba, Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria, will present key findings from the 2021 book, “COVID-19 and Sovereign Debt: The Case of SADC”, a multi-disciplinary publication focusing on the issue of African sovereign debt management and renegotiation/restructuring in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

Join us on Tuesday, December 13, for a discussion on COVID-19, sovereign debt and the case of the SADC region. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnus is an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.
