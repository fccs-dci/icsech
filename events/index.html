        JAPAN’S ROLE IN ASIAN REGIONAL SECURITY

        Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine one year ago, Japan has begun significantly upgrading its national security posture. It announced plans to double defense-related expenditures to equal 2 percent of GDP in five years and updated three of its key national security documents. Meanwhile, Japan and the US have strengthened their alliance through a Biden-Kishida summit at the White House and a series of meetings between their top economic policy and security/defense teams. What is Japan’s goal, and what other steps may be necessary to harden the resilience of its supply chains for goods, energy, and food? Professor Kanehara of Doshisha University, who helped formulate security policy while serving as assistant chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from 2012 to 2019, will discuss the role Japan should play in the alliance with the US and share his comprehensive view of security from a geopolitical perspective.

        Cooperation in higher education has been one of the foundational elements in US-China relations. Today, there are over 350,000 students from the PRC studying in undergraduate and graduate programs across the US. In addition, over the course of four decades, US and Chinese universities have built up an array of collaborative research projects that have resulted in a growing number of publications in top tier refereed journals. The relationship in higher education seemed to be of substantial benefit to both sides, even if there have been shifts in geopolitical currents and a variety of on-going issues to be resolved.

Most recently, however, with the souring of the overall bilateral political relationship, the bilateral higher educational relationship has encountered numerous challenges. The number of US students wanting to study in China has declined, and the number of Chinese students willing to come to the US also has diminished. For many PRC students, getting a visa to come to the US has proven increasingly problematic because of tighter US controls. Research collaboration also has declined precipitously because of growing national security and competitiveness concerns. It seems as if things are moving in a downward spiral with no bottom in sight. The proposed panel will examine evolving trends and developments regarding US-China university cooperation and exchanges. The experienced panelists will offer their frank assessment about the prospects for the future, commenting on those forces that will shape the bilateral higher education relationship in both the short and medium-to-long term.

        中国能否成为发达国家取决于未来中国的创新力，而创新力很大程度上取决于人口因素。中国人口正在面临巨大的变化，生育率快速下降，总人口负增长，年轻人口迅速减少，这将严重削弱中国的创新力和经济活力。我们通过“人口创新力模型”，分析了影响人口创新力的四个效应，即规模效应、聚集效应、流动效应和老龄化效应，并且利用最新的经济学理论和各个国家的数据，解析了低生育率对经济的各个方面的影响，并提出了人口战略和一整套切实可行的改革措施，其中包括减轻生育成本和教育负担等建设性意见。搜索“大学沙龙&quot;YouTube频道收看讲座。

        India ChIna Institute will host a series of online seminars from February 27-March 10, titled &quot;Flows, Infrastructure and Citizenship in India and China.&quot; The seminars are being organized by Dr. Sarandha Jain, the 2022-3 post-doctoral fellow at ICI. The four dialogues will explore how flows, infrastructures, and citizenship encounter each other, and what their co-arrangements mean for the evolving nature of the state. How do flows of people, objects, and natural substances facilitate and/or obstruct the constructions of infrastructure, and vice versa? How do these flows relate similarly to constructions of citizenship? The dialogues will position a scholar of India in conversation with a scholar of China to discuss common themes in their work. The opening dialogue will lay the groundwork for the series’ broader intellectual aims by connecting the three conceptual and empirical frameworks. The three subsequent dialogues, while still focusing on the triadic relationship between the frameworks, will emphasize each of the elements by engaging scholars of India and China who specialize in flows (for the 2nd dialogue), infrastructure (for the 3rd), and citizenship (for the 4th).

Speakers will include ProfessorsTownsend Middleton, of the Department of Anthropology at University of North Carolina,Ka-Ming Wu, of the Cultural and Religious Studies Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong,Ritajyoti Bandyopadhyay, of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research,Yimin Zhao, of the School of Urban Planning and Management at Renmin University of China,Sunalini Kumar, of School of Global Affairs at Ambedkar University,Amy Zhang, of the Department of Anthropology at New York University,Suraj Gogoi, of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences at RV University, andAndrew Grant, of the International Studies Program at Boston College.

        This seminar will examine Africa in the evolving BRI with special interest in security. It will firstly take stock of Africa in the BRI at a time of change and questions about the trajectory of a transcontinental nature that has been repositioning Africa’s previous salience in China’s foreign policy in the global South. Almost all African states have signed up to the BRI, which has also been integrated into the official China-Africa cooperation framework. In practice, however, the BRI remains a work in progress. Second, and drawing on such cases as Mali and South Sudan, it will examine the multifaceted theme of security in Africa’s engagement with the BRI and in terms of how China’s multi-level engagement has been evolving. In doing so, particular attention will be dedicated to examining China’s official rationale concerning the efficacy of economic development as key to overcoming security challenges.

        About the event

China’s staggering economic development over the past four decades owes much to the effectiveness of its tax system. Wei Cui, a professor of law and tax expert at the University of British Columbia, will share highlights from his 2022 bookThe Administrative Foundations of the Chinese Fiscal State, in which he introduces the politics, policies, and practices of tax collection in China. He argues that China offers an alternative paradigm in revenue mobilization for the developing world. NYU Law Professor Mitchell Kane, editor-in-chief of the Tax Law Review, will be the moderator.

        On Tuesday, February 28, 2023, at 5p.m. PT, the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Wei-Ping Lin to discuss her newly published work,Island Fantasia: Imagining Subjects on the Military Frontline between China and Taiwan. This is a virtual event which will be livestreamed on our Facebook and YouTube pages.Click here to register.

The Matsu archipelago between China and Taiwan, for long an isolated outpost off southeast China, was suddenly transformed into a military frontline in 1949 by the Cold War and the Communist–Nationalist conflict. The army occupied the islands, commencing more than 40 long years of military rule. With the lifting of martial law in 1992, the people were confronted with the question of how to move forward. Professor Lin’s in-depth ethnography and social history of the islands focuses on how individual citizens redefined themselves and reimagined their society. Drawing on long-term fieldwork, Lin shows how islanders used both traditional and new media to cope with the conflicts and trauma of harsh military rule. She discusses the formation of new social imaginaries through the appearance of “imagining subjects,” interrogating their subjectification processes and varied uses of mediating technologies as they seek to answer existential questions.

        In 1933, as Japanese armies ravaged China, a small band of Chinese museum curators in Peking packed the imperial art collections of the Forbidden City for evacuation to safety.

For sixteen years, these devoted curators shepherded twenty thousand cases of irreplaceable art through war-torn China. The cases traveled by steamship and train, truck and bamboo raft. They journeyed thousands of miles up vast rivers and over mountain ranges, through bombing and famine, across the unimaginable destruction of China’s second world war.

Overseeing this extraordinary effort of conservation was Professor Ma Heng, a reticent, unassuming scholar of ancient inscriptions. Professor Ma’s decades-long commitment to preserving the imperial art collections of China brought him, at the end of his life, only fear and humiliation.

In Fragile Cargo, Adam Brookes brings us – for the first time in English – the story of Ma Heng, the wartime curators of Peking, and their invaluable cargo.

        The “spy balloon” episode took the wind out of the stated purpose of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s now-postponed China visit, which was aimed at achieving rapprochement between Washington and Beijing. The dominant view among the US strategic affairs community sees the downing of the “spy balloon,” the cancelled visit of Blinken, and now the refusal by the US president to apologize for “killing” the civilian Chinese airship, as the formal launching of a New Cold War amid increasing hostility between the two rival nations. Although Beijing criticized the US’s “irrational” action as an “overreaction,” analysts abroad and within the mainland are interpreting China’s quick apology for the Chinese flying object mistakenly entering the US air space as [China’s] unwillingness to escalate “balloon” row. Besides, other voices, including the Washington-based think tank CSIS, the Wall Street Journal, and a high-ranking Chinese diplomat, have argued that the entire matter should have been treated and dealt with as a diplomatic episode. Thechargé d'affairesof the Chinese embassy in Washington Xu Xueyuan wrote in an article in the US media that China-US relations should not be “led astray by a wandering balloon.” The raisond’etrefor downplaying the controversy has been interpreted by some as Beijing’s objective to “restore and develop the economy” that has been dragged down by the three-year epidemic in 2023.

This panel discussion will analyse the incident and deliberate on the following questions: a) has the storm over the balloon robbed Washington and Beijing of an opportunity; b) if this is really the beginning of a New Cold War, what are the security implications in the Indo-Pacific; c) does an intensification of US-China competition indicate that China could queer the pitch for India’s G20 presidency this year; d) is the balloon row really the spectacle that the Biden administration will use “to push its stuttering election cart”; and, last but not least, e) what does one make of the fact that China figured at least five times in Biden’s POTA speech.

        This roundtable features a research project that moves beyond canonical textual sources to advance the study of Daoism through archaeological and epigraphic materials, including statues, stele inscriptions, cave shrines, temple inscriptions, and inscribed tomb epitaphs. By using these understudied sources to augment the canonical sources these speakers will seek to further understand the social history of Daoism and explore developments and changes in ritual practices that are often invisible in the canonical records. These materials are located in various sites in China and the temporal spread of the project is from the 5th to the 17h century. Collectively, these presentations help us understand how the Daoist faith was lived and experienced in everyday life.

About the event
The massive protests that roiled Hong Kong in 2019 and their political aftermath comprised both complex political and social phenomena and intense personal narratives. Rowena He, an associate professor of history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, will reflect on the events of 2019-2022 using narrative accounts drawn from her interactions with Hong Kong and mainland Chinese students in the territory. Connecting the personal with the social, the political, and the historical, she will unpack the nuances, contradictions, and challenges posed by an unprecedented social movement and its ongoing impacts.

        HOW DOMESTIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL POLITICS SHAPE CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

        A conversation between Prof William Hurst and Prof Pete Gries on how both domestic and foreign policy shapes China in IR.

Most international relations scholarship ignores or oversimplifies the role of domestic politics. Conversely, most analysis of domestic politics, even in reference to the making and implementation of foreign policy, downplays or occludes the influence of international factors. Only by looking at the two in tandem can we make significant headway. Ruling governing coalitions make foreign policy largely to advance domestic political aims and agendas, but they do so in international structural environments that incentivise and constrain their strategies and behaviour.

By looking at China’s relationships with the United States and several Southeast Asian countries over time, I propose a theory of interaction between domestic and international factors to explain the dynamics of Chinese foreign policy and international relations more broadly.

        The Midwest is making a comeback! With more and more tech companies moving operations to the Heartland region, so comes an influx of remote workers inland from coastal cities. The trend of this burgeoning tech industry outside of Silicon Valley and increase of megatech companies and startups is derived from a trust in the Midwest and increased global investment in the inland region. How does the Heartland capitalize on this nationwide transition inward? What does this mean for Heartland residents and what economic and innovation policies can we expect?

Join USHCA for our second event in our Authors Series this year, as we invite Rebecca A. Fannin to discuss her latest book “Silicon Heartland: Transforming the Midwest from Rust Belt to Tech Belt.” Originally from the Heartland region, Rebecca also has covered Asia in three prior books including Tech Titans of China, and has spoken on many major news outlets as an expert on Asia’s entrepreneurial boom. She has an established career in journalism as a CNBC contributor and in 2010, launched the media platform Silicon Dragon Ventures. Her new book, “Silicon Heartland”, recounts the roots of her own journey ─ and also brings explores our region’s comeback from the Rust Belt to a Tech Belt. The event will also feature moderator Dan Schwartz, a past publisher of AVCJ in Hong Kong, author of The Future of Finance, and currently a member of the Band of Angels in Silicon Valley. He previously served as Nevada State Treasurer from 2015 to 2019.

        China has witnessed a rising number of singles in recent years, including the unmarried, divorced and widowed. The number of people who live alone is also on the rise, especially in cosmopolitan cities and coastal areas. This rising single population gave rise to an emerging ‘singles economy’ (danshen jingji), marked by growing demand for mini-apartments for solo dwellers, appliances for one-person households, food delivery services tailored to ‘singletons’, tour packages for single men and women, companion pets, and boyfriend and girlfriend-renting services.

I will unpack China’s growing ‘singles economy’ through a case study of the date-renting industry, which has become a thriving part of the Chinese economy. Through analysis of various date-renting websites and drawing on the theories that focused on the intersection of romance/emotions and the market/capitalism, I identify the logic of the date-renting industry and the gendered strategic presentation of ‘date-traders’ online. I argue that the boundary between emotions and capitalism has become increasingly blurred as these two seemingly opposing forces are converging, constituting a unique phenomenon in China’s singles economy. This manifests as an economically moulded dating culture intertwined with new, intricate social and personal relations – a by-product of China’s demographic shifts and rapidly growing market economy.

        The Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984 and transferred control of Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China from 1 July 1997. This set the scene for the establishment of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) in Hong Kong. Lim uses British archival sources to re-examine the Joint Declaration, the negotiations that led up to it and its resounding significance. Beginning with Margaret Thatcher’s preparations for her Beijing trip, his recent book, Treaty for a Lost City: The Sino-British Joint Declaration (Cambridge University Press, 2022) takes a chronological approach. In light of current developments, Lim will set out to explain some of the legal complexities that have underpinned the relationships between China, Hong Kong and Britain since 1979.

        This talk introducesImperial Gateway, which explores the political, social, and economic significance of colonial Taiwan in the southern expansion of Japan's empire from 1895 to the end of World War II. The book uncovers a half century of dynamic relations between Japan, Taiwan, China, and Western regional powers. Japanese officials in Taiwan did not simply take orders from Tokyo; rather, they often pursued their own expansionist ambitions in South China and Southeast Asia. When outright conquest was not possible, they promoted alternative strategies, including naturalizing resident Chinese as overseas Taiwanese subjects, extending colonial police networks, and deploying tens of thousands of Taiwanese to war. The Taiwanese—merchants, gangsters, policemen, interpreters, nurses, and soldiers—seized new opportunities for socioeconomic advancement that did not always align with Japan's imperial interests.Imperial Gatewayshows how Japanese officials and Taiwanese subjects transformed Taiwan into a regional gateway for expansion in an ever-shifting international order.

        Standard narratives of the Chinese past present &quot;China&quot; as a continuous entity since ancient times, attaining its current territorial shape through cultural osmosis rather than military force, and presiding over a peaceful, hierarchical and Sinocentric system of Asian states maintained through Confucian deference. This vision has been promoted by Chinese governments, but it is also commonplace in survey courses, textbooks and popular culture produced outside of China, especially in the Anglophone world, and is even routinely referenced by politicians and diplomats from the US. It is also patently wrong, as anyone who has ever read any Chinese history knows: wars and conquest have been no less common in China and East Asia than anywhere else; modern migrations by Chinese into &quot;frontiers&quot; backed by state power have displaced indigenous peoples in ways reminiscent of European settler colonialism in the Americas, and the legacy of this expansion remains problematic decades after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in the territory of the former Qing empire. This lecture will examine how three key concepts in the historiography of China, &quot;Sinicization,&quot; the &quot;tribute system&quot; and &quot;Chinese dynasties,&quot; have ingrained and perpetuated an inaccurate exceptionalism in how we talk about the past and present of peoples and states in geographical China.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        What would development look like if its practitioners and scholars were ‘against NGOs,’ challenging common sense about them? This book presents a critical perspective on NGOs, describing how they emerged as key agents of development over time. Through an interpretative history based on Gramscian concepts it shows how civil society organizations were gradually enlisted in development as non-state technocratic actors. The book argues that management studies and development studies emerged as commonsensical explanations for capitalist crises. Each offered complementary solutions to balance the needs of capital and society, in particular historical circumstances. These solutions also situated civil society as agents of development and vectors of management. Against NGOs fills a gap within the literature of management and development studies through its original discussion of their historical interconnections and shared themes. The book raises provocative questions on what forms of knowledge-politics can respond productively to the crises of our contemporary moment.

        IR scholars often define prestige as “reputation for power” and argue for its significance in the context of high-stakes negotiations, the dynamics of power transition, or (bi-polar) competition to attract allies and partners. Famously, Giplin argued that for international relations prestige is “enormously important” – even more so than power itself. This is because “if your strength is recognized, you can generally achieve your aims without having to use it.” But whereas Giplin and others correctly conceptualize the power of prestige in driving desired outcomes, there is yet little attention to what exactly it means for strength to be “recognized,” and who is doing the recognizing.

Drawing on the “visual turn” in IR and starting from the original (visual) connotation of prestige as “dazzling influence” and “glamour,” this talk interrogates the links between prestige and recognition from the vantage point of the politics of aesthetics. For the purpose, I turn to select cases linked to China’s bid for international prestige, especially based on the invocation of common (Silk Road) past and shared future. I show how, in different communities, visual representations and public displays disrupt standard formulations of a shared (Silk Road) past and also bring forth alternative understandings of the meaning and work of prestige. These cases, I suggest, can help clarify not only the important links between power and recognition, but can also showcase the need for critical exploration of prestige in relation to empire and ontologies of power, the complexities of post-colonial order, and the evolving spaces for political agency.

        Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s



Book Talk with Chien-Wen Kung (National University of Singapore) 



O﻿nline Event 



*﻿RSVP requested

The UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Chien-Wen Kung to discuss his newly published monograph, Diasporic Cold Warriors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Philippine Chinese were Southeast Asia and possibly the world’s most exemplary overseas Chinese Cold Warriors. Fears of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Southeast Asia’s Chinese as conduits for PRC influence gripped states and societies then – as indeed they do today. Yet, ironically, the example of the Philippines shows that the &quot;China&quot; which intervened the most extensively in any Southeast Asian country during the Cold War was not the PRC. It was, rather, the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. Drawing upon archival research and fieldwork in Taiwan, the Philippines, the United States, and China, Diasporic Cold Warriors tells for the first time this story of the Philippine Chinese as anticommunist partisans by tracing their evolving relationship with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Philippine state over the middle third of the 20th century.

Chien-Wen Kung is an Assistant Professor of History at the National University of Singapore and the author of Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s. His scholarship has also been published in Modern Asian Studies, the International History Review, and Asian Ethnicity. Born and raised in Singapore, he received his B.A. in History and English from Dartmouth College and Ph.D. in Modern Chinese and International and Global History from Columbia University. With funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and National Heritage Board in Singapore, he is currently working on a cultural history of Singapore-China-Taiwan relations in the 1970s and 1980s.

        In this talk, Silvia Lindtner,Associate Professor in the School ofInformation andPenny W Stamps School of Art and Design at the Univesrity of Michiganwill draw from ethnographic research she has conducted over the last 14 months across two sites in China: 1) small-scale businesses that center on alternative food and spiritual practices via life in nature and the countryside and 2) large-scale, data-driven agricultural experiments at the outskirts of major urban centers. Prof. Lindtner will discuss how these two sites interact for the implementation of two recent state policies on “rural revitalization” and “national strengthening.” These policies are aimed at reinvesting into China’s “hinterlands:” from rural farmland to people’s most inner selves. They position data-driven techniques of automation, surveillance technology, and smart systems as key to the state’s ability to manage life that has partially escaped the state’s reach. And they call upon China’s youths who have turned away from the city to live and work in China’s countryside to co-produce what she calls “data engines,” i.e. a participatory form of techno-governance driven by an engineering mindset that aims to cultivate citizens as productive selves who operate on behalf of the party state and its ambition to build a “strong China” by turning inwards—China’s history, soil, and agriculture. Data engines, she shows, simultaneously enable, and slow down the automation of China’s soil and soul.

        The King’s Road offers a new interpretation of the history of the Silk Road, emphasizing its importance as a diplomatic route, rather than a commercial one. Tracing the arduous journeys of diplomatic envoys, Xin Wen presents a rich social history of long-distance travel that played out in deserts, post stations, palaces, and polo fields. The book tells the story of the everyday lives of diplomatic travelers on the Silk Road—what they ate and drank, the gifts they carried, and the animals that accompanied them—and how they navigated a complex web of geographic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. It also describes the risks and dangers envoys faced along the way—from financial catastrophe to robbery and murder. Using documents unearthed from the famous Dunhuang “library cave” in Western China, The King’s Road paints a detailed picture of the intricate network of trans-Eurasian transportation and communication routes that was established between 850 and 1000 CE.

By exploring the motivations of the kings who dispatched envoys along the Silk Road and describing the transformative social and economic effects of their journeys, the book reveals the inner workings of an interstate network distinct from the Sino-centric “tributary” system. In shifting the narrative of the Silk Road from the transport of commodities to the exchange of diplomatic gifts and personnel, The King’s Road puts the history of Eastern Eurasia in a new light.

        In this talk, India China Institute’s Postdoctoral Fellow Sarandha Jain will discuss her PhD dissertation, which studies the oil-mediated relationship between the Indian state and citizens. Focusing on both oil production and consumption, presenting ethnography of oil refineries, research institutes, state offices, a peri-urban working-class-neighborhood near Delhi, and ‘black markets’, her talk examines oil as an infrastructure for the state and for society. She argues that the Indian state distributes itself into citizens’ lives via petroleum products, which obtain their sociopolitical agencies while being produced in certain ways, and play out those agencies while being consumed in certain ways. Her ethnography of refineries details out the microprocesses of oil refining and the complex relationship that human and nonhuman actors share. It elaborates on how politics get programmed into petroleum products, designed to discipline consumer-citizens into particular lifestyles, and how varying actors encumber this. Research on oil consumption with ‘black-marketeers’ and ordinary consumers of petroleum products, probes “distorted discipline”, where governmental plans get mangled by the informal practices of state actors as well as citizens. How does the politics programmed into petroleum products in refineries actually play out once other actors intervene, and snatch control over oil away from the state? Investigating this tussle between legalized and illegalized groups, she describes how it structures citizens’ lives, and the constellations of power and forms of sociality it gives rise to. This talk highlights the constant churning between the state and citizens through ever-evolving devices of government, as well as through escape from them. Specific modes of subjectification, engineered through flows of oil, lie at the heart of this churning, over which state-citizen formations are negotiated.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	Relationships with bureaucracies, commercial counterparts and civil society in host countries
	
	Communist party influence on organisational structure, style of operating and incentive and penalties for employees.
	
	How Chinese companies manage the complexities of operating in international environments including language, host country markets, unfamiliar political systems, and cultural milieus as well as with competition from other commercial entities.
	
	Case studies of particular Chinese companies operating abroad, or conversely, a range of Chinese companies operating in a particular host country.


The publishing outcomes of this conference will include a special issue proposal toThe China Journal.

If you are interested in participating, please send a 250 word abstract, a brief CV and your institutional affiliation to the conference organiser, Dr Greg Raymondgreg.raymond@anu.edu.auby30 March 2023. A limited number of travel bursaries may be available – please enquire if needed
