        Scholars of post-colonial shaped Southern Urbanism, across ideological persuasions, could view Mumbai’s fastest growing district Malad, and Kowloon’s Sham Shui Po’s to be set within a common narrative. Malad Mindspace and InOrbit Mall to future neighbouring Somwari Bazar’s densely-packed industries; newcomers to Hong Kong’s Kowloon sited ‘slum’-looking tenements with archaic, densely tenanted balconies would assume these to give way to clichéd high-end cafés and malls housing Starbucks. Locating such territories as urban renewal, ‘Speculative Urbanism’, or where ‘gentrification’ settles capital’s frontier built around Accumulation by Dispossession (ABD), leads to attempts to ‘provincialize’ ABD and incorrectly locate such territories as ‘slums and Informal’. Halvorsen (2019) rightly questions such underlying dominant Anglophone perspectives derived from the Westphalian state. However, for him, the ‘South’ remains as ‘hybrid’: sites of ‘multiplicities and diversity’, rather than understood in terms of entangled interactions between different forces.

In this talk, Benjamin &amp;amp; Tang discuss their co-authored work with Rupali Gupte and Prasad Shetty: ‘Land’s Mutual Embeddedness in Property Relations &amp;amp; and Territory’. Here, aTongbianunderstanding allows a serious consideration of the ‘thickness’ of property with overlaid ‘situated histories’ representing entangled and fluid relationships. This is central in analysing change premised on difference without alienation, rather than the idea of dialectics. This shift in approach allows us a conceptual entry into state spaces and practices that are otherwise represented, again across ideological positions, as patron-clientelism whose ‘vote bank’ politics poses popular groups as a deviant society, roped in as local agents of a global value chain.

The zoom lecture in Chinese language is intended to untangle the mysterious “Dean Lung” stories and examine century-long Chinese imagination in a larger backdrop of China-U.S. relations. The clarification and demystification of “Dean Lung” Chinese identity and stories through anthropological and sociological approach will shed light on intriguing pioneers and complicated histories related to Columbia Chinese studies in the early years.

        How is China acquiring global influence? How does China align with autocracies as partners to its global ambitions? And how is China using technology imports and the spread of Chinese technical standards to assert dominance over the emerging digital economy? Richard Carney will explore these questions in a talk based on findings from his forthcoming book with Cambridge University Press,China's Chance to Lead.

        The area studies model was a particular US invention during the Cold War, and ever since Bruce Cumming’s seminal essay &quot;Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War&quot; [1997], there have been academic debates in the US on the “uses and abuses” of this model and its implication for cross-cultural knowledge production. As early as 2017, a document issued by the Chinese Ministry of Education had inaugurated a new phase for the discipline, and by 2018, more than 400 research centers had been established at top Chinese universities dedicated to various regions of strategic importance, including Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, etc. Bringing together prominent area studies scholars from China and the US, this interdisciplinary faculty roundtable aims to explore the future promise as well as lessons of the area studies model in China and the US.

        In May 1877, the British government of the Straits Settlements set up the Chinese Protectorate. Five months later, the Qing government established a Chinese consulate in Singapore. What is the literary-historical impact of the rivalry between the Straits Settlements government and the Qing government on matters regarding migrant Chinese labor and customs? Using archival sources such as mining agreements and colonial textbooks, I consider this, as well as the Chinese question in late nineteenth-century Southeast Asia through the wider lens of extractive capitalism and land tenure across Malaya, Sarawak, and Patani.

        Can ideas mobilize people into collective action? Ying Bai of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and his co-authors investigate this question by analyzing how exposure to Communist ideology shaped an individual’s decision to join the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during its formative stage. Their study focuses on cadets at the Whampoa Military Academy, who played crucial roles in China’s major 20th-century conﬂicts. Their identiﬁcation strategy leverages the locality-time-content variation in the circulation of the New Youth magazine—the primary platform promoting Communism following the Treaty of Versailles in 1919—and the variation in an individual’s location over time. Comparing Whampoa cadets living in a locality with access to post-1919 New Youth against those who lived in the same locality but missed this channel, they ﬁnd that the former were signiﬁcantly more likely to join the CCP, and that this party choice was consequential in subsequent conﬂicts. They also ﬁnd that family background did not predict party choice, but that social networks complemented ideology exposure. In this Quantitative History Webinar, Ying Bai will present their analyses of other periodicals and organizations that support post-1919 New Youth’s role as a proxy for Communism penetration in a locality.

        In this Quantitative History Lecture, Debin Ma of the University of Oxford will present his paper which revisits the old thesis of the contrasting paths of modernization between Japan and China. It develops a new analytical framework regarding the role of ideology and ideological change—Meiji Japan’s decisive turn towards the West pitted against Qing China’s lethargic response to Western imperialism – as the key driver behind this contrast. They show that the structural difference between Tokugawa Japan’s feudal, decentralized political regime and Qing China’s centralized bureaucratic system generated differential benefits and costs for regime change and ideological realignment in mid-19thcentury. Debin Ma and his team build a historical narrative to trace the origin of this political bifurcation to the Medieval period. Their new analytical framework supported by a historical narrative and empirical evidence highlights the crucial role of regime change during late 19thcentury China and Japan through the lens of ideological change as distinctive but complementary elements of culture and institutions.

With a career spanning 47 years at the Library of Congress, Susan Meinheit has had a pioneering role in the development, management, and conservation of the Library of Congress' vast Tibetan collection, one of the largest in the world. From her first LC position as a library clerk, it was through her area and language expertise -- combined with sheer determination -- that she essentially carved out her role as steward and champion of LC's long-neglected early TIbetan holdings which were based on the collections of three major scholars of Tibet and southwest China and acquired by LC in the early 1900s. Meinheit will talk about the early history of the collection; the growth of the collection through the PL-480 Books program with India, and achievements in bringing wider visibility of the Tibetan holdings through major cataloging and digitization initiatives.

        在中国人的生活中，“大一统”几乎是与“中国”“天下”齐名的重要概念，一般意义上，人们很容易把“大一统”仅仅理解成一个“空间”占有的概念，即一个有声望的王朝应该拥有足够大的版图。实际上，“大一统”观来源于《春秋公羊传》，其涵义十分复杂。“大一统”并不仅仅是一种思想，还表现为具体的政治实践，甚至是一套复杂的文本构造技术。
首先，“大一统”与古代的“正统观”联系紧密，是“正统观”中的第一要义。其次，“大一统”与“夷夏之辨”的观念时常纠葛在一起，成为区分以“文化”优势划分种族差异，还是以统一多民族共同体形式进行统治的一个关键概念。第三，“大一统”推行的程度还是古代帝王在建立道德教化规则的同时，衡量其政治军事绩效的一个重要参照系。
“大一统”观在近代受到了双重冲击，一方面，革命党人通过“反满”运动一度间接否定了“大一统”的重要性，后来又在与立宪派的争论中重新肯定了“大一统”的价值，另一方面，“大一统”观至今为止仍是抵抗西方侵略，进行民族主义动员的有力工具。

        As China opened up its economy over the past four decades, conventional wisdom held that the country’s growing embrace of free markets would lead to a more liberal society. Instead, China’s unprecedented economic growth has positioned state capitalism as a durable foil to the orthodoxy of free markets, to the confusion of many in the West. Xi Jinping was recently appointed to a third five-year term as China’s supreme leader, and has increasingly doubled down on state control of the economy and many have commented on his renewed embrace of Maoist principles. What does this mean for the future of the Chinese economy and relations with the West? What are the implications of China returning to some of the ideological principles spearheaded by Mao Zedong? And how much of China’s decades of economic success can be credited to Mao and Maoism?

Christopher Marquis will discuss his new book, Mao and Markets (Yale University Press, 2023) which examines these questions and charts how Mao’s ideological principles, mass campaigns, and socialist institutions have enduringly influenced Chinese entrepreneurs, listed companies and provincial and city politicians.

        With China’s tacit support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been much talk in global media about a new China-Russia alliance against the West. This has been supported by evidence of military cooperation, such as joint naval drills in the East China Sea in December 2022, as well as Xi Jinping’s advocacy of an authoritarian “Beijing model” as an ideological and political alternative to the “Washington consensus”. But China and Russia have a long history of conflict as well, from imperial Russian aggressions against Qing China, to the Sino-Soviet split during the Cold War.

So what are the prospects for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century? How do mainland Chinese view Russia? We are joined by four scholars currently working on different aspects of China-Russia relations:


	Ed Pulford, Lecturer in Chinese Studies, Manchester (Chinese views of Putin; Sino-Russian friendship);
	Elena Barabantseva, Senior Lecturer in Politics, Manchester (male Chinese views of Russian and Ukrainian women);
	Tao Wang, Hallsworth Research Fellow, Manchester (what surveys reveal about Chinese attitudes towards the Russian invasion of Ukraine);
	Yi Wang, Assistant professor in politics, U. Birmingham (recent Chinese social media debates over Russia).

        In this talk, India China Institute’s Postdoctoral Fellow Sarandha Jain will discuss her PhD dissertation, which studies the oil-mediated relationship between the Indian state and citizens. Focusing on both oil production and consumption, presenting ethnography of oil refineries, research institutes, state offices, a peri-urban working-class-neighborhood near Delhi, and ‘black markets’, her talk examines oil as an infrastructure for the state and for society. She argues that the Indian state distributes itself into citizens’ lives via petroleum products, which obtain their sociopolitical agencies while being produced in certain ways, and play out those agencies while being consumed in certain ways. Her ethnography of refineries details out the microprocesses of oil refining and the complex relationship that human and nonhuman actors share. It elaborates on how politics get programmed into petroleum products, designed to discipline consumer-citizens into particular lifestyles, and how varying actors encumber this. Research on oil consumption with ‘black-marketeers’ and ordinary consumers of petroleum products, probes “distorted discipline”, where governmental plans get mangled by the informal practices of state actors as well as citizens. How does the politics programmed into petroleum products in refineries actually play out once other actors intervene, and snatch control over oil away from the state? Investigating this tussle between legalized and illegalized groups, she describes how it structures citizens’ lives, and the constellations of power and forms of sociality it gives rise to. This talk highlights the constant churning between the state and citizens through ever-evolving devices of government, as well as through escape from them. Specific modes of subjectification, engineered through flows of oil, lie at the heart of this churning, over which state-citizen formations are negotiated.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
