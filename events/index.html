        CHINA’S TECHNO-DEVELOPMENTAL STATE: ACHIEVING THE FUTURE

        In 2014, China’s leadership put forward the goal of becoming a “strong network country” (wangluo qiangguo), and the current 14th Five-Year Planning cycle puts digital technology at the heart of China’s social and economic development priorities. In contrast to the first wave of digitised states in the West, China has adopted a far moredirigistepolicy approach, in which the government takes a dominant role in setting objectives, mobilising resources, intervening through regulation and coordinating action.

As such, China constitutes a “techno-developmental state”, which intends to use technology for economic and financial growth, but also for the delivery of state services in response to constantly evolving demands. Its evolution, however, does not occur in a vacuum: although the lions’ share of Beijing’s attention is devoted to domestic considerations, changing international circumstances are significantly impacting China’s access to foreign resources, technologies and markets, as well as its bid for greater influence in technical and political governance forums.

How does the Chinese Party-State use digital technology to achieve its development goals, and how does it adapt itself in the process? This presentation will discuss the shifting circumstances that China faces, and the parameters that will shape China’s future as a leader in cutting-edge technology, as a digital economic powerhouse, and a digital society.

        While conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Northwest China in 2014, anthropologistDarren Bylerfound that a Uyghur language novel, The Backstreetsin Ürümchi, helped Uyghurs to narrate their own stories. By shifting the frame of the narrative of colonial violence away from the authority of the state toward the work it takes for the colonized to live, this difficult, absurdist fable gave young Uyghurs a way to articulate experiences of dehumanization and rage. With its English-language translation and publication, it also gave the novelist, Perhat Tursun, a way of refusing his own silencing through censorship and, ultimately, imprisonment.

The Backstreets in Ürümchi is a novel by Perhat Tursun, a leading Uyghur writer, poet, and social critic from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Perhat Tursun has published many short stories and poems as well as three novels, including the controversial The Art of Suicide (1999), decried as anti-Islamic. In 2018, he was detained by the Chinese authorities and was reportedly given a sixteen-year prison sentence. Byler was a cotranslator with ‘Anonymous,’ who disappeared in 2017, and is presumed to be in the reeducation camp system in northwest China. This event would be meaningful to students and faculty in many different areas of the university including the above proposed cosponsors, and students of China and Inner Asia.

        This talk brings from the archives a hitherto unknown case of a minor scholar from Northern China who punished brutally for writing 16 characters about “barbarians” that he wrote on the margins of a forgotten 3rd century book. The talk traces the history of case all the way back to the 3rd century, and analyses it by looking at the scholarly and familial lineages to which it belonged. Looking at the ethnographical dimensions of the case we then turn to discuss what it means for New Qing History and particularly Qing ideology during the Qianlong period.

        This is the first among a couple of thousand books to examine the full panorama of Winston Churchill’s India connections, which divide into four phases that are explored in the book. It starts with the 3 years as a cavalry subaltern (1896-99), a formative phase when he planned his political career. In 1929, when his Tory Party was in opposition, he rebelled against its position on gradual self-rule in India, starting with provincial devolution. His 6-year futile struggle against the India Act of 1935 isolated him from his own party colleagues, leaving him in the political wilderness in 1929-39. The outbreak of WWII brought him back into the Cabinet and he served as Prime Minister from Feb 1940 to August 1945. Churchill engaged in aberrant actions, including gross lies about the Indian National Movement’s intentions, plus several threats to resign over India policy. By early 1942, it was clear that the British Empire was at an end. Ostrich-like, Churchill was in denial, even while scheming with Jinnah on a Muslim homeland. Placing the entire leadership of the National Movement in prison and isolation, from August 1942 to mid-1945, he did nothing to prepare for that end phase, and the inevitable Partition. This was his supreme folly. Churchill bears responsibility for doing nothing to counter the mismanagement in British India during the Great Indian Famine of 1942-44, and his extended refusal to provides ships to bring food grains that Australia and Canada were willing to donate. Willful mismanagement, indifference to mass starvation in East India, and gross failure to plan the end of Empire, these are the serious charges that stand against Churchill. They are a major failure, a gross black spot, in what is otherwise a
great life of remarkable achievement.

        We are now in the midst of what has been called a global “chip war” with China, the United States, and Taiwan considered to be the major players. This situation is the result of the globalization within the semiconductor industry that began in the 1960s. Southeast Asia was a major site for such outsourcing by US firms such as Fairchild Semiconductor, Hewlett Packard, and General Electric. This paper examines some of the local effects of the electronics and semiconductor industries in Singapore. In particular, it examines the effects of these industries on gender norms and family life in the newly independent city state. By examining the forms of labour and patterns of development associated with early semiconductor outsourcing, the paper aims to shed light on the long-term cultural and geopolitical effects of globalization within the chip industry.

        The Hoover Project on China’s Global Sharp Power invites you toChina's Response to War in UkraineonTuesday, February 7, 2023from10:00 am - 11:15 am PT.

This talk assesses how China's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has varied across four domains: informational, diplomatic, economic, and military. China's stance appears to be shaped by several factors, including a perceived need to counter the United States and therefore a desire to support Russia while minimizing the costs of doing so to Chinese interests. China's desire for internal political stability and the increasingly personalist nature of its regime and political system also appear to have shaped its decision-making, as has its evolving assessments of what the Ukraine conflict might mean for Taiwan.

        Many experts have expressed fears about paralysis of the United Nations system following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has deadlocked the permanent five members of the UN Security Council. Professor Bing Bing Jia, one of China’s leading international law scholars, takes a more optimistic view. He argues that the UN continues to show its unique and irreplaceable strengths as a forum for diplomacy and for breaking political stalemates through application of international law. In conversation with USALI Faculty Director José E. Alvarez, Jia will discuss how, in his view, the UN is able to represent the international community and deal with challenges to international law more effectively than smaller groupings such as the G-20 or European Union.

        “The Jesuit mission to China more than four hundred years ago has been the subject of sustained scholarly investigation for centuries. Focusing on the concepts of friendship and hospitality as they were both theorized and practiced by the Jesuit missionaries and their Confucian hosts, this book offers a new, comparative, and deconstructive reading of the interaction between these two vastly different cultures. Dongfeng Xu analyzes how the Jesuits presented their concept of friendship to achieve their evangelical goals and how the Confucians reacted in turn by either displaying or denying hospitality. Challenging the hierarchical view in traditional discourse on friendship and hospitality by revealing the irreducible otherness as the condition of possibility of the two concepts, Xu argues that one legacy of the Jesuit-Confucian encounter has been the shared recognition that cultural differences are what both motivated and conditioned cross-cultural exchanges and understandings.” (Google Books)Prof. Xu’s book was published by the State University of New York Press in 2021. 

Dongfeng Xu is Assistant Professor of Chinese at Colgate University where he teaches courses on literature, language, and CORE. He was a Visiting Assistant Professor at UHM in 2012-14.

        CUHK LAW GREATER CHINA LEGAL HISTORY SEMINAR SERIES – “GROUNDED AT KAI-TAK: CHINESE AIRCRAFT IMPOUNDED IN HONG KONG 1949-1952” BY MR. MALCOLM MERRY (ONLINE)

        Towards the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 as Communist forces advanced southwards, aircraft of the Nationalist government’s two main airlines took refuge at Kai Tak airfield in the then British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. There followed a three-year struggle for control of the aircraft on the ground, in the courts and among ministers and diplomats on three continents.

In this seminar Malcolm Merry, author of the recently published Grounded at Kai Tak, Chinese Aircraft Impounded in Hong Kong 1949-1952 (HKUP), will outline the story of the struggle. It is a saga of colourful characters, political intrigue, legal manoeuverings and unexpected turns which strained the UK’s relations with the authorities in the US, Hong Kong and China. The British government insisted that ownership of the planes was purely a question of law but encountered resistance from the colony’s governor, its judges, the Americans and the new regime in China. The fate of the planes became entangled with international post-war tensions and domestic American politics which inevitably meant that the struggle was far more than a simple legal contest.

About the Speaker:
Malcolm Merry spent more than 40 years in Hong Kong as a practising barrister, author, lecturer/senior lecturer and associate/adjunct professor at the University of Hong Kong. He is known for his writing on land law but more recently has developed an interest in and published works on Hong Kong’s legal history including two books with HKUP, The Unruly New Territories (2020) and Grounded at Kai Tak (2022).

CPD credit is available upon application and subject to accreditation by the Law Society of Hong Kong (currently pending).

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

In this special event at the Historic Reading Room of the John Rylands Research Institute and Library, the speakers will adopt a novel ‘mirror’ approach by pairing and comparing people, texts, gifts, commodities, artworks, architecture, ideologies, operating systems and world views of the two empires. While interweaving the most known diplomatic efforts at the official level with the much unknown intellectual interactions at the people-to-people level, this approach allows an analysis of how the two empires created frameworks for understanding “Self and Other” from both Sino-centric and Anglo-centric points of departure, telling stories that have been understudied in the grand narratives, and reflecting on their implications on today’s bilateral relations.

The event also marks the opening of the new China Culture Gallery at the Manchester Museum, where various narratives on historical Anglo-Chinese encounters will also be exhibited.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        On Tuesday, February 28, 2023, at 5p.m. PT, the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Wei-Ping Lin to discuss her newly published work,Island Fantasia: Imagining Subjects on the Military Frontline between China and Taiwan. This is a virtual event which will be livestreamed on our Facebook and YouTube pages.Click here to register.

The Matsu archipelago between China and Taiwan, for long an isolated outpost off southeast China, was suddenly transformed into a military frontline in 1949 by the Cold War and the Communist–Nationalist conflict. The army occupied the islands, commencing more than 40 long years of military rule. With the lifting of martial law in 1992, the people were confronted with the question of how to move forward. Professor Lin’s in-depth ethnography and social history of the islands focuses on how individual citizens redefined themselves and reimagined their society. Drawing on long-term fieldwork, Lin shows how islanders used both traditional and new media to cope with the conflicts and trauma of harsh military rule. She discusses the formation of new social imaginaries through the appearance of “imagining subjects,” interrogating their subjectification processes and varied uses of mediating technologies as they seek to answer existential questions.

        This talk introducesImperial Gateway, which explores the political, social, and economic significance of colonial Taiwan in the southern expansion of Japan's empire from 1895 to the end of World War II. The book uncovers a half century of dynamic relations between Japan, Taiwan, China, and Western regional powers. Japanese officials in Taiwan did not simply take orders from Tokyo; rather, they often pursued their own expansionist ambitions in South China and Southeast Asia. When outright conquest was not possible, they promoted alternative strategies, including naturalizing resident Chinese as overseas Taiwanese subjects, extending colonial police networks, and deploying tens of thousands of Taiwanese to war. The Taiwanese—merchants, gangsters, policemen, interpreters, nurses, and soldiers—seized new opportunities for socioeconomic advancement that did not always align with Japan's imperial interests.Imperial Gatewayshows how Japanese officials and Taiwanese subjects transformed Taiwan into a regional gateway for expansion in an ever-shifting international order.

        WHEN DO CHINESE COURTS STAND WITH THE PEOPLE? | CHAO-YO CHENG

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.
