        INFRASTRUCTURAL SPLINTERING ALONG THE BRI: CATHOLIC POLITICAL ECOLOGIES AND THE FRACTIOUS FUTURES OF SRI LANKA’S LITTORAL SPACES

        This talk considers the ways in which the material infrastructures of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) intersect with other infrastructural formations, and how the resulting overlaps can trigger processes of what I call “infrastructural splintering”. These processes cause infrastructure to be experienced in differentiating ways, creating divisive politics where there might once have been unity. Embracing these politics as an analytical starting point undermines the techno-material stability of the BRI, and reveals its more-than-material affects. I illustrate these ideas by developing a case study of the effects of the China-backed Colombo Port City project on Catholic fishing communities that are dependent upon the aquatic commons for survival. The construction of the Port City has brought about significant aquatic pollution and ecosystem destruction, and public erasure by Colombo’s political elites. Complicating matters is the dominance of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka’s littoral spaces, which has become divided by a universalist politico-ecological consciousness imposed by the Vatican, a corruptible local hierarchy, and environmental activists that engage communities by working through the Church’s sacred infrastructures. By working through these processes of infrastructural splintering, I consider how the BRI has caused Sri Lanka’s littoral spaces to face increasingly fractious futures.

        《奥本海默》是今年最重要的现象级电影作品。观众和导演都没有想到，它的故事与多项历史事件和当下热词迎头相撞：战争、核战威胁、战争中的平民、间谍、法西斯、反犹……讨论从电影的形式系统进入，通过分析影片的叙事结构、电影方法来探索和解密诺兰导演对传主奥本海默的呈现，影片对一些世纪难题的回应。讨论大致在这几个方面展开：一、影片与当下世界语境。二、中国热议和中国删减。三、叙事结构。四、电影方法，圆形人物(Round Character)和杂耍蒙太奇。五、超现实意象与奧比的内疚。六、历史时刻焊接：毒苹果和水池里的黑手。七、哥本哈根之夜，科学家的主体责任。八、杜鲁门的白手绢与雅思贝尔斯论四种罪责。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道收看讲座。

        Social cohesion has been identified as a key element of Australia's national interest, underpinning Australia's prosperity and security. The media play an important role in building social cohesion. This presentation discusses how exposure to media content about the PRC and Chinese-Australian communities impact on Australia’s social cohesion objectives. The discussion draws on data from recent focus group meetings, a large quantitative survey, and in-depth interviews with twenty individuals.

        In the past ten years the number of initiatives that have collected and analyzed rich datasets regarding physical infrastructures has grown substantially. One of the major challenges with these initiatives is to facilitate and foster reuse and integration of data – across different projects and across different disciplines. Linked Data and Semantic Web principles are increasingly applied by researchers and industries as a means to ensure that data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable within and across different fields. This symposium will bring together experts from industry and academia to discuss methodological and ontological approaches to modelling and analyzing material infrastructure using Linked Data principles and together distill a number of best practices. This event is sponsored by the NWO-funded project “The Lives and Afterlives of Material Infrastructures in Southeast China”. Researchers in this and an allied ERC project based at KU Leuven aim to map the appearance and disappearance of large-scale infrastructures on an open access spatial analysis platform based on the digital annotation of the extant textual and archaeological record. Our goal is to promote a dialogue between industry, government institutions, and academia and to facilitate the development of broadly applicable ontologies and methodologies.

Program

For this symposium, we invite participants to speak in one of two sessions.

The first session will address ontologies and modelling standards. We ask that participants speak about their own work and address the following questions:

• What are the key decisions that need to be made when modelling infrastructure,
• How can different data sources be integrated?
• How can changes in infrastructure use, function, and materials be described?

The second session will be devoted to the analysis and visualization of infrastructure data, in which we would like participants to discuss:

• How they analyze infrastructure data,
• what visualizations they generate, and
• what software, services or technologies they use.

Speakers will give a brief overview of their work in relation to the session theme (8-10 minutes). This will be followed by a larger roundtable discussion at the end of each session.

Countries have been opting for influence in the “Global South” to build legitimacy for their positions and actions. Yet, little is known on how citizens see these actors’ different types of engagements with their host countries. We are drawing on an original survey dataset from South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Nigeria (N=8000) and present novel findings of this larger project. Who do citizens prefer their country to align with – China, Western countries, others or none? What explains citizens' alignment preferences? To what degree does Chinese soft power contribute to its overseas image and what other factors determine how citizens of these selected countries view China?

Abstract:

China’s draconian response to COVID-19 drew considerable criticism, with many suggesting that intense digital surveillance and harsh lockdowns triggered the unusual public dissent seen in China in late 2022. However, this lecture argues that rather than backfiring, digital surveillance may have legitimized the government’s overreaction by making uncertain threats appear certain. The authors collected data on daily counts of lockdown neighborhoods and COVID cases from 2020 to 2023. Using a difference-in-differences approach with World Value Surveys (China 2012, 2018) and a nationwide online survey in 2023, they show that real-world lockdowns significantly reduced public perception of respect for human rights and trust in the government; however, these effects are moderated by the pervasiveness of COVID surveillance, proxied by cellphone usage. To establish causality, the authors use a survey experiment to show that digital surveillance indeed increases support for COVID lockdowns by making citizens more likely to believe they are close contacts. In contrast, surveillance cannot justify protest crackdowns. The findings suggest that uncertainty in threats to public safety may foster support for state surveillance and coercion.

Abstract:

A central question in political economy asks: how do developing states build market-supporting institutions (e.g., secure property rights, contract enforcement, and the rule of law)? Too often, political obstacles prevent developing statesfromadopting strong formal institutions. In this book, Lizhi Liu proposes that China has devised a novel solutiontothis political problem: institutional outsourcing. Liu argues that, with weak rule of law, the state has outsourced part of its institutional functionstokey private actors, which she calls, private regulatory intermediaries (PRIs). Using as the context China’s e-commerce market, where 800 million active users generate more than 100 million transactions per day, Liu shows that online trading platforms (e.g., Alibaba’s Taobao.com and Tmall.com) have beguntoserve as PRIs. More specifically, platforms privately supply market-supporting institutionstoenforce contracts, prevent fraud, and settle disputes. In additiontolegal functions, the state has effectively off-loaded a part of social and political functionstoplatforms. Not only do platforms enforce rules, they also assist the state in creating and reforming formal institutions through institutional experiments. Liu demonstrates that institutional outsourcing, as an alternative routetoinstitutional development, is a more politically viable solutiontomarket failure and governance deficit than the direct reforming of formal institutions. She further shows in the bookthat, China's e-commerceboomcarries profound effects on state-business relations, household welfare, and the stability of the authoritarian regime in general.

This book project employsa mixed methods approach and draws on a variety of original or proprietary data. Qualitatively, Liu has conducted over 200 interviews during 14 months of fieldwork, supplemented by nine years of online ethnographic research. Quantitatively, she analyzes original datasets that include the web-scraped information of 1.76 million online stores, an original national survey, and a longitudinal survey on 2,800 households conducted with a large-scale field experiment.

Abstract:

Authoritarian governments are increasingly promoting political control enabled by digital technologies in the name of protecting public security and strengthening social order. The repressive nature of the extensive, oftentimes unchecked digital control has been deliberately hidden away from public discourse and expands in the absence of substantive political accountability. How do ordinary citizens under autocracy react emotionally when facing digital control such as surveillance and censorship implemented by its government? To which extent do triggered emotions relate to changes in citizens’ political attitude? To answer these questions, we employed a survey experiment (N=4507) in China and conducted 50 in-depth interviews from our fieldwork in the country. Our study sheds light on the nuanced political-psychological consequences of digital control under authoritarian rule. It highlights when confronting digital control, negative feelings such as anger, disgust, and helplessness increase, but rather moderately; one’s positive sentiment, however, decreases to a much stronger and greater extent. A worsening of political attitudes, especially asked in hypothetical term, is another significant consequence of knowing about digital control. In general, these effects are stronger in the aspect of digital surveillance, as compared to digital censorship; and also greater when digital control measures are perceived in personalized term rather than in public terms. Overall, our study enriches current understandings of the formation and alteration of political attitudes toward digital control and unveils specific emotional mechanisms that are at play.

Abstract:

In the digital era, data serves as the “new oil,” shaping economic dynamics, societal norms, and governance frameworks. China has notably evolved its approach to big data governance, punctuated by the launch of its Big Data Strategy in 2015 and the establishment of the State Data Bureau in 2023. Despite these developments, there is limited scholarly understanding of the rationales behind these changes and their potential ramifications. This study scrutinizes the evolving policy focus and governance structure in China’s big data landscape based on a comprehensive review of official documents. Additionally, the research delves into the potential challenges within the current governance architecture, particularly in terms of bureaucratic politics, including both formal structures and individual resistance. Our preliminary findings provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamism in China's big data governance strategy and offer insights into potential obstacles and challenges confronting future policy implementation and public administration.

Abstract:

Digital surveillance is a daily and all-encompassing reality of life in China. This book explores how Chinese citizens make sense of digital surveillance and live with it. It investigates their imaginaries about surveillance and privacy from within the Chinese socio-political system.

Based on in-depth qualitative research interviews, detailed diary notes, and extensive documentation, Ariane Ollier-Malaterre attempts to ‘de-Westernise’ the internet and surveillance literature. She shows how the research participants weave a cohesive system of anguishing narratives on China’s moral shortcomings and redeeming narratives on the government and technology as civilising forces. Although many participants cast digital surveillance as indispensable in China, their misgivings, objections, and the mental tactics they employ to dissociate themselves from surveillance convey the mental and emotional weight associated with such surveillance exposure.

The book is intended for academics and students in internet, surveillance, and Chinese studies, and those working on China in disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, social psychology, psychology, communication, computer sciences, contemporary history, and political sciences. The lay public interested in the implications of technology in daily life or in contemporary China will find it accessible as it synthesises the work of sinologists and offers many interview excerpts.

        The project 'Regionalizing Infrastructures in Chinese History' invites scholars of Chinese and European archaeology and history to participate in the international workshop 'Perspectives on the Materiality of City Walls in China and Europe'. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different archaeological contexts to share best practices in the analysis of archaeological knowledge production, to identify key issues within existing practices, and to explore approaches to materiality in archaeology by examining case studies from various geographical areas and historical eras.

Participants are invited to submit preliminary position papers (up to 5 pages) which will be discussed during the two sessions. Travel for participants will be covered within Europe.

Panel 1:Archaeological reporting(10.00 - 12.30)

How researchers engage with the materiality of city walls, the capacity of those walls to modify the perception and action of humans, depends often on local approaches to the material. On one hand, archeological reports serve as a starting point for reconstructing archaeological knowledge-making processes in different locations and, by extension, for discerning theoretical trends and dominant ideas in archaeological science. On the other hand, archaeology is notorious for the amount of gray literature it creates. How do we facilitate access to this information as archaeologists? How do we extract meaningful data from them?

The reports, both published and unpublished, create opportunities to discuss methodological approaches, different frameworks, as well as blind spots of archaeological reporting. This panel invites researchers to examine how the materiality of city walls shape the perception and action of archaeologists, policymakers, and others who engage with the material remains of city walls in the present by addressing, among others, the following questions:

● Are there local, regional, and national trends in archaeological research on city walls (and infrastructure in general)?

● Are city walls a priority in choosing sites? Are certain time periods given priority?

● Is research on city walls only driven from above (i.e. by new infrastructure development and state-sponsored tourism), or does some of it come from below?

● Can digital technologies facilitate local, regional, and global comparative investigations of material remains of city walls?

Panel 2:Materiality and communication(14.00-17.00)

Andrea Mubi Brighenti and Mattias Kärrhold, in their introduction toUrban Walls: Political and Cultural Meanings of Vertical Structures and Surfaces(2018),refer to walls asmaterial and semiotic technologies of inter- visibility managementand walling as atechnology of social interaction. In archaeological interpretations, city walls delineate ingroups and outgroups; they demonstrate seemingly clear borders between past and present regimes. In recent years the renewed interest in city walls as tourist attractions has made it so that city walls everywhere are treated as local/national symbols. City walls create bonds and barriers to this day; they are sources of safety and alienation, and in recent years walls are a source of revenue through tourism. They also influence city planning and community relations. This panel explores how city walls create social relations by examining, among others, the following questions:

● How are memories of city walls transmitted? What is the role of city walls in inculcating culture (generatinghabitus)?

● How are experiences of the materiality of city walls reflected in archaeological finds of different groups?

● How do city walls mediate the relationship between the sacred and the profane?

● How have city walls enabled infrastructural violence and inequality in the past? Do they have an impact on violence and inequality today?

● How can archaeological research into the materiality of city walls help us understand and address contemporary teichopolitics?

Deadline for abstracts (up to 200 words):December 1, 2023.
