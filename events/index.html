        This book is an in-depth examination of the regulatory, entrepreneurial, and organizational factors contributing to the expansion and transformation of China’s supplemental education industry. Like many parents in the United States, parents in China, increasingly concerned with their children’s academic performance, are turning to for-profit tutoring businesses to help their children get ahead in school. China’s supplemental education industry is now the world’s largest and most vibrant for-profit education market, and we can see its influence on the US higher education system: more than 70% of Chinese students studying in American universities have taken test preparation classes for overseas standardized tests. This book examines how opportunistic organizations thrived in an ambiguous policy environment and how they catalyzed organizational and institutional changes in this industry.

A former insider in China’s Education Industry, UHM sociologist Le Lin shows how and why this industry evolved to become a for-profit one dominated by private, formal, nationally operating, and globally financed corporations, despite restrictions the Chinese state placed on the industry.

In conversation with:

Yan Long, UC Berkeley, Assistant Professor of Sociology. Her research centers on the interactions between globalization and authoritarian politics across empirical areas such as civic action, health, development and technology. 

Baoyan Cheng, UHM, Professor of Comparative and International Education at the Educational Foundations Department,College of Education. Her recent researchfocuses on the international mobility of Chinese students.

Organizer &amp;amp; Moderator: Xu Peng, UHM, Assistant Professor of Theatre &amp;amp; Dance. She specializes in theater and performance studies, women and gender studies, andpremodern literature.

Co-sponsored by the UHM Departments of Educational Foundations, Sociology, and Theatre &amp;amp; Dance.

        China is steadily sliding into an era of highly centralized one-man rule. The recently concluded 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party not only confirmed Xi Jinping as China's top leader for a third term, but packed the party’s senior ranks with his own close associates while sweeping out anyone not affiliated with him. Fordham Law Professor Carl Minzner will share his analysis of what we can expect for the next decade (or more) of Xi Jinping rule, based on the speeches and documents from the party congress and other recent messaging. He also will discuss what all this could mean for foreign scholars trying to conduct research in China and engage with peers there. Katherine Wilhelm, U.S.-Asia Law Institute executive director, will moderate.

“Every time I return to China (whether on specific topics or not), I become increasingly aware of the passage of time between visits and my inability to keep pace with the country. It has been a human impulse to collect images like souvenirs as a reminder of the experience. Yet, the documentary images serve as a perfect metaphor from the fragmentary nature of memory and the desire to take ownership of it.”

Zhang’s work with India China Institute establishes the continuity between disjointed experiences by bringing individual lives in China to the forefront of contextual discourse. This digital archive closely examines life in a society that is in a perpetual state of flux. In addition, Zhang will share his thoughts on the process of archiving and what it means to make archival material accessible to the public.

As Dr. Roland Benoit, a German neuroscientist once said, “Our memory is not made for the past, but for the future.” So is the project – BEING.

        This talk will first discuss strategies dictators use to minimize the chance of an elite coup against them. Although elite politics in China in the 1980s was characterized by power sharing, rehabilitated veterans did not want internal challenges to their spheres of influence. Thus, instead of favoring officials slightly younger than them or well-connected princelings, they opted to promote a large number of politically unconnected technocrats to senior positions. Meanwhile, princelings faced resistance to their promotion, especially those who sought positions in Beijing. The result of this decentralized &quot;coalition of the weak&quot; strategy was that by the 2000s, few princelings were still in the running for top positions. Those who were left could draw on their vast networks of princelings, especially princelings in the PLA, in their competition with less-connected technocrats. This created the structural conditions for Xi's complete domination of the party soon after taking power.

        The launch of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) initiative in South China is one of the most important national strategies adopted by the Chinese government in recent years. It brings both opportunities and challenges to the development of the cities in the GBA. Tax laws and fiscal policies have been employed by GBA governments to facilitate the promotion of various industries. In the GBA, there is no unified tax law scheme, as three different tax regimes are implemented in the GBA mainland area, Hong Kong and Macau respectively. This seminar will discuss tax harmonisation and competition within the GBA for both talents and investment. Hong Kong’s simple and low tax system is no longer its unique advantage in the GBA and Hong Kong needs to face reality and take action to improve its attractiveness.

About the Speaker:
Dr. Jingyi Wang is an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Law, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Jingyi’s research and teaching interests focus on comparative tax law and fiscal policy. Her recent work examines taxation of the digitalised economy, Chinese tax law reform, information exchange, tax administration and Hong Kong tax policies. Her publications appear in British Tax Review, Australian Tax Forum and Hong Kong Law Journal.

CPD credits are available upon application and subject to accreditation by the Law Society of Hong Kong (currently pending).

        The trading voyages to the Pearl River delta made by British, American and European ships in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were the longest and most hazardous in the world. Some were circumnavigations of the globe in an era when large areas of the globe were still unknown to western explorers. This paper makes two arguments: first, that the international and multi-ethnic personal and businessnetworks formed by merchants were a means of mitigating the many risks of these long-distance ventures, and that non-western actors played a central role in this; second, that maritime insurance became a key risk-reducing device developed by thesenetworks to help grow this commerce in a period before the Opium Wars, when foreign trade with China remained restricted to Canton. This is the first work to examine how tradingnetworks and their insurance practices in Asia enabled the riskiest of trades to be managed successfully.

        Drawing on surveys, interviews and documentary searches, and employing both quantitative and qualitative methods, Dr. Zweig's presentation shows that a key to understanding the process of reverse migration of talent back to China is to focus on what he calls &quot;a theory of shortage.&quot;

As several returned scientists, academics, and entrepreneurs remarked almost 20 years ago, the strategy they employed when they went abroad and the key to their successful return to China was their ability to find a skill or a technology which was in short supply in China and thereby gave them a comparative advantage vis-a-vis locals who had not gone abroad in China's marketplace or in China's scientific or academic institutions.

Even younger people who went abroad for shorter periods of time for an MA or an undergraduate degree found that the skills they developed abroad are an important part of their &quot;transnational human capital,&quot; and greatly affect their satisfaction with their lives and their work.

Dr. Zweig suggests that this phenomenon demonstrates the reasons for returnees' success as well as for China's technological progress in catching up with the West.

        If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that the world is bound together by shared challenges—and that at the center of those challenges stands China. Thanks to decades of breakneck growth and development, Chinese officials, businesses, and institutions now play a critical role in every major global issue, from climate change to biotechnology. China’s Next Act re-envisions China’s role in the world in terms of sustainability and technology. This reframing is essential both because none of these increasingly pressing, shared global challenges can be tackled without China, and because they are reshaping China’s economy and its foreign policy, with major implications for the world at large. At the same time, sustainability and technology issues present opportunities for intensified economic, geopolitical, and ideological competition—a reality that Beijing recognizes.

The danger is that China’s next act will drive divergence on the rules and standards the world desperately needs to tackle shared challenges in the decades ahead. In some areas, like clean technology development, competition can be good for the planet. But in others, it could be catastrophic: only cooperation can lower the risks of artificial intelligence and other disruptive new technologies.

The challenges posed by climate change, pandemics, and emerging technologies make dealing with China’s state, its firms, and other institutions more complex and more critical than ever before. China’s Next Act helps foreign countries, companies, and other organizations prepare for a future shaped by sustainability, technology—and a dramatic new chapter for China and the world.

        Part of the University of Chicago Center for East Asian Studies' East Asia by the Book! CEAS Author Talks series, this event will take place virtually on Zoom. Hear the author, Professor Haun Saussy, talk about his recent publication. Debates on the canon, multiculturalism, and world literature often take Eurocentrism as the target of their critique. But literature is a universe with many centers, and one of them is China. The Making of Barbarians offers an account of world literature in which China, as center, produces its own margins. This book investigates the meanings of literary translation, adaptation, and appropriation on the boundaries of China long before it came into sustained contact with the West. Professor Saussy focuses on the period before 1850, when the translation of foreign works into Chinese was rare because Chinese literary tradition overshadowed those around it. This publication looks closely at literary works that were translated into Chinese from foreign languages or resulted from contact with alien peoples. It explores why translation was such an undervalued practice in premodern China, and how this vast and prestigious culture dealt with those outside it before a new group of foreigners—Europeans—appeared on the horizon.

        In many advanced countries, traditional forms of capitalism have increasingly come under criticism as contributing to economic and social inequality and failing to serve the needs of society. To address these shortcomings, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is proposing a “new form of capitalism” for the country. In the US, business leaders talk about promoting “stakeholder capitalism” over “shareholder capitalism.” Law Professors Gen Goto and Curtis J. Milhaupt will discuss the similarities and differences between these two sets of ideas and the implications for corporate governance and society.

        About the Books
(Foreign Banks and Global Finance in Modern China: Banking on the Chinese Frontier, 1870-1919)
In this wide-ranging study, Ghassan Moazzin sheds critical new light on the history of foreign banks in late nineteenth and early twentieth century China, a time that saw a substantial influx of foreign financial institutions into China and a rapid increase of both China’s foreign trade and its interactions with international capital markets. Drawing on a broad range of German, English, Japanese and Chinese primary sources, including business records, government documents and personal papers, Moazzin reconstructs how during this period foreign banks facilitated China’s financial integration into the first global economy and provided the financial infrastructure required for modern economic globalization in China. Foreign Banks and Global Finance in Modern China shows the key role international finance and foreign banks and capital markets played at important turning points in modern Chinese history.

(Hong Kong Takes Flight: Commercial Aviation and the Making of a Global Hub, 1930s–1998)
Commercial aviation took shape in Hong Kong as the city developed into a powerful economy. Rather than accepting air travel as an inevitability in the era of global mobility, John Wong argues that Hong Kong’s development into a regional and global airline hub was not preordained. By underscoring the shifting process through which this hub emerged, _Hong Kong Takes Flight_ aims to describe globalization and global networks in the making. Viewing the globalization of the city through the prism of its airline industry, Wong examines how policymakers and businesses asserted themselves against international partners and competitors in a bid to accrue socioeconomic benefits, negotiated their interests in Hong Kong’s economic success, and articulated their expressions of modernity.

        Today American institutions dominate nearly every major ranking of global universities. Yet in historical terms, America’s preeminence is relatively new, and there is no reason to assume that U.S. schools will continue to lead the world a century from now. Indeed, America’s supremacy in higher education is under great stress, particularly at its public universities. At the same time Chinese universities are on the ascent. Thirty years ago, Chinese institutions were reopening after the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution; today they are some of the most innovative educational centers in the world. Will China threaten American primacy?

Empires of Ideas looks to the past two hundred years for answers, chronicling two revolutions in higher education: the birth of the research university and its integration with the liberal education model. William C. Kirbyexamines the successes of leading universities—The University of Berlin and the Free University of Berlin in Germany; Harvard, Duke, and the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States—to determine how they rose to prominence and what threats they currently face. Kirby draws illuminating comparisons to the trajectories of three Chinese contenders: Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, and the University of Hong Kong, which aim to be world-class institutions that can compete with the best the United States and Europe have to offer. But Chinese institutions also face obstacles. Kirby analyzes the challenges that Chinese academic leaders must confront: reinvesting in undergraduate teaching, developing new models of funding, and navigating a political system that may undermine a true commitment to free inquiry and academic excellence.

In this MCI webinar, Prof. Kirby will delve deeper into the key points of his acclaimed book and participate in a Q&amp;amp;A session subsequent to the talk.

        In May 1983, two Chinese engineers spent ten days visiting the decrepit Bolton Falls Dam on the Winooski River in upper Vermont. The visit likely raised eyebrows on both sides of the Pacific. Unlike most of their countrymen, who were sent abroad on study tours by their home institutions in China, these engineers were in Vermont at the invitation of the dam’s American owners, the Green Mountain Power Corporation. Having failed to obtain an affordable renovation plan from domestic consultants, Green Mountain had only done the logical thing and turned to the global leaders in small hydropower: China. In this talk, which draws upon ongoing research for a book on the history of small hydropower in China, Dr. Ghosh will first briefly trace China’s rise to a position of global leadership in small hydropower. Ghosh then will explore the activities of the Chinese-American engineer Alexander A.S. Tseng and the company he founded, Oriental Engineering &amp;amp; Supply Company (ORENCO). In 1972, Tseng was a member of the first delegation of Chinese-American scientists to visit the PRC. Recognizing China’s expertise and experience in small hydropower, Tseng set up ORENCO and brought that expertise to the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, helping build or restore nearly forty small dams across the country.

        Sometime during the 10th to 13th centuries CE a system of long-walls (or 'Great Walls') was built in areas currently in North China and Northeastern Mongolia. This network of walls, forts, and enclosures covers an estimated area of 4000 km and spans a wide range of ecozones, from the deserts of western China to the steppes of northern Mongolia and the Khingan mountain range. While this is one of the longest and most elaborate systems of its kind the world has ever seen, it is unclear who built it, when exactly it was built and for what purpose. Prof. Shelach-Lavi is heading a new research project, titledThe Wall(https://thewall.huji.ac.il/), which combines archaeological, geographic, historic and paleo-climatic data to date, map and analyze this extensive wall-system. In this talk he will report on the work done so farand on new insights that it generated.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        Silvia Lindtner is working on two intertwined topics at the moment: on the one hand, she looks at how data-driven experiments in computer science are applied to transform China's agriculture. This mostly involves research in large-scale farming experiments at the outskirts of China's big cities (precision farming, partnerships between SOEs, Chinese universities' computer science programs, and international/multinational partners). On the other hand, she looks at how these large-scale (and often state-driven) data-driven experiments sit alongside what some have described as a broader &quot;inwards&quot; turn - specifically, she has been doing research with a younger generation of transnational Chinese who decide to move to rural China instead of taking the high-tech jobs in Shanghai and San Francisco, experimenting with permaculture farming, eco-farming, and various forms of spiritual and shamanistic practice. Her initial research sites were in rural Jiangxi and Guangdong, but she is now working on establishing access to some sites here in Yunnan, since there are quite a few activities here as well. Part of her bigger argument is that both the large-scale data-driven farming experiments and the &quot;youths turning inwards&quot; phenomenon are enrolled into two of the state's major policies, &quot;rural revitalization&quot;乡村振兴 and &quot;digitization/data-driven transformation&quot; 数字化, each framed as key to China's future challenges of national sovereignty and food security.

        Dr Bingchun Meng has written extensively about Chinese social media and its subjects. She provides a profound analysis of topics such as knowledge production, gender research and power structure, social science studies standpoints and academic awareness in different social contexts in China and the West. Her recent publication, The Politics of Chinese Media: Consensus and Contestation (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), offers an analytical account of the consensus and contestations of the politics of Chinese media at both institutional and discursive levels. It considers the formal politics of how the Chinese state manages political communication internally and externally in the post-socialist era, and examines the politics of news media, focusing particularly on how journalists navigate the competing demands of the state, the capital and the urban middle class readership. The book also addresses the politics of entertainment media, in terms of how power operates upon and within media culture, and the politics of digital networks, highlighting how the Internet has become the battlefield of ideological contestation while also shaping how political negotiations are conducted. Bearing in mind the contemporary relevance of China’s socialist revolution, this text challenges both the liberal universalist view that presupposes ‘the end of history’ and various versions of China exceptionalism, which downplay the impact of China’s integration into global capitalism.

        The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the public finances of African countries. It also led to rising debt levels in many African countries and has increased concerns about their ability to make their scheduled sovereign debt payments over the next few years. This looming debt crisis raises questions about how these countries can most effectively manage their debts and how their creditors can help them develop in sustainable and inclusive ways. Daniel Bradlow, SARCHI Professor of International Development Law and African Economic Relations at the University of Pretoria, and Magalie Masamba, Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria, will present key findings from the 2021 book, “COVID-19 and Sovereign Debt: The Case of SADC”, a multi-disciplinary publication focusing on the issue of African sovereign debt management and renegotiation/restructuring in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).

Join us on Tuesday, December 13, for a discussion on COVID-19, sovereign debt and the case of the SADC region. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        THE HIGH COST OF CHINA'S DISENGAGEMENT (FEAT. GEORGE MAGNUS)

        For more than three decades, the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence. Neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train. Markets were markets, business was business, and multinational firms became more multinational. Not anymore.

In this new era of strategic competition between China and the West, disengagement is the order of the day. While this trend will impede economic growth, increase business costs (via supply-chain restructuring), and raise prices for everyone, the economy that loses the most may well be China’s.

This webinar examines the costs of China's disengagement by paying particular attention to international trade, investment and capital markets, as well as knowledge transfer, geopolitics and global technological development.

About the Speaker

George Magnus is an independent economist and commentator, and Research Associate at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

George was the Chief Economist, and then Senior Economic Adviser at UBS Investment Bank from 1995-2012. He had a front row seat and key managerial position for multiple episodes of boom and bust in both advanced economies and emerging markets, including notably the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. George famously anticipated it in 2006-2007 with a series of research papers in which he warned of an impending Minsky Moment.

His China focus derives from a long period of observation and study that goes back to his first visit in 1994. He is a regular contributor to the Financial Times, Prospect Magazine, BBC TV and radio, Bloomberg TV and other outlets.

George’s current book,Red Flags: why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy(Yale University Press, 2018) examines China’s contemporary economic and commercial challenges and aspirations to modernity in the light of a governance system that is a throwback to much earlier times in the People’s Republic. His earlier books areThe Age of Aging(2008), which investigated the effects of the unique experience of demographic change on the global economy; andUprising: will emerging markets shape or shake the world economy?(2011) which examined the rise of China and other major emerging markets, and questioned controversially the widely accepted narrative that China was destined to rule the world.
