        The Making of China’s Post Office traces the origins and early development of the country’s modern postal system. Sweeping in perspective, it goes beyond the bounds of institutional history to explore the political maneuverings, economic imperatives, and societal pressures both inhibiting and driving forward postal development. Although its prime mover was Robert Hart, Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, the wider cast of characters includes foreign and native staff, Qing officials, local administrations, commercial interests, and foreign governments.

        本次讲座从比较历史研究和政治经济学理论互动的角度，讨论《通向现代财政国家的路径》一书。该书详尽的比较历史研究背后的问题意识，是如何解释从旧制度均衡到现代财政国家的新制度均衡的复杂因果过程。在这一过程当中，现代财政国家制度只是可能出现的多个均衡中的一个，并非唯一的可能结果。比较历史研究能否为制度变迁提供一个非线形的因果解释？这一基于历史考察的因果解释有没有成为理论模型的可能？参与讲座的两位嘉宾，将从政治经济学研究的不同角度，展开批判性对话。搜索“大学沙龙”YouTube频道收看讲座。

        Sparks: China's Underground Historians and their Battle for the Future describes how some of China's best-known writers, filmmakers, and artists have overcome crackdowns and censorship to forge a nationwide movement that challenges the Communist Party on its most hallowed ground: its control of history. The past is a battleground in many countries, but in China it is crucial to political power. In traditional China, dynasties rewrote history to justify their rule by proving that their predecessors were unworthy of holding power. Marxism gave this a modern gloss, describing history as an unstoppable force heading toward Communism's triumph. The Chinese Communist Party builds on these ideas to whitewash its misdeeds and glorify its rule. Indeed, one of Xi Jinping's signature policies is the control of history, which he equates with the party's survival. But in recent years, a network of independent writers, artists, and filmmakers have begun challenging this state-led disremembering. Using digital technologies to bypass China's legendary surveillance state, their samizdat journals, guerilla media posts, and underground films document a regular pattern of disasters: from famines and purges of years past to ethnic clashes and virus outbreaks of the present--powerful and inspiring accounts that have underpinned recent protests in China against Xi Jinping's strongman rule. Based on years of first-hand research in Xi Jinping's China, Sparks challenges stereotypes of a China where the state has quashed all free thought, revealing instead a country engaged in one of humanity's great struggles of memory against forgetting—a battle that will shape the China that emerges in the mid-21st century.

        The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), ten years since it began, has become China’s guiding foreign engagement and economic governance principle in the Xi Jinping era. However, questions remain — with regards to their implementation, why do megaprojects encounter such divergent responses — with some gaining local support while others causing local grievances? This paper addresses these questions by conducting sub-national level analysis and by applying the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) in tracing the rise and fall of economic-centered coalitions in the Kenyan Standard Gauge Railway project, one of the most controversial and influential China-financed megaprojects of the BRI. The paper is part of a book project on the impact of Chinese-led infrastructure megaprojects in the Global South, based on fieldwork in China and Kenya between 2015 and 2023, and over 300 surveys and interviews with stakeholders involved with BRI project development and community-based project impact assessment. Our findings suggest that the BRI developed its current form from China’s domestic experience driven by economic interests, which laid the foundation for economic-centered coalitions that contributed to progress during project construction. Yet. such coalitions fluctuated with interest redistribution, which changed project outcomes, and led to future uncertainties in project development and Initiative success. The research project fills the gap in existing literature by providing a sub-national perspective on the impact of Chinese overseas engagement and provides a new pathway for assessing China’s growing sphere of influence.

        International negotiations about climate change have long been anchored in frameworks of carbon emissions and net-zero targets. However, this framing has not necessarily captured the most meaningful goals for many parts of the world that are coping with some of the most intense effects of climate change. Their concerns have centered around other issues such as the availability of water, the rise in extreme heat, air pollution, and shifts in patterns of biodiversity and agriculture. These issues are undoubtedly connected to emissions, and yet the dominant framework has often determined the production of knowledge, the determination of targets, and the design of interventions, in ways that have elided the concerns of different parts of the world. This panel will bring together scholars and practitioners from the Global South who will discuss the perspectives of climate change that are most trenchant in their parts of the world.

The panel is part of an ongoing series organized by the India China institute on emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older putatively liberal international order dominated by US leadership. By focusing on alternative frameworks, it seeks to broaden and make more representative differing ways of understanding and addressing climate change.

        The project 'Regionalizing Infrastructures in Chinese History' invites scholars of Chinese and European archaeology and history to participate in the international workshop 'Perspectives on the Materiality of City Walls in China and Europe'. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different archaeological contexts to share best practices in the analysis of archaeological knowledge production, to identify key issues within existing practices, and to explore approaches to materiality in archaeology by examining case studies from various geographical areas and historical eras.

Participants are invited to submit preliminary position papers (up to 5 pages) which will be discussed during the two sessions. Travel for participants will be covered within Europe.

Panel 1:Archaeological reporting(10.00 - 12.30)

How researchers engage with the materiality of city walls, the capacity of those walls to modify the perception and action of humans, depends often on local approaches to the material. On one hand, archeological reports serve as a starting point for reconstructing archaeological knowledge-making processes in different locations and, by extension, for discerning theoretical trends and dominant ideas in archaeological science. On the other hand, archaeology is notorious for the amount of gray literature it creates. How do we facilitate access to this information as archaeologists? How do we extract meaningful data from them?

The reports, both published and unpublished, create opportunities to discuss methodological approaches, different frameworks, as well as blind spots of archaeological reporting. This panel invites researchers to examine how the materiality of city walls shape the perception and action of archaeologists, policymakers, and others who engage with the material remains of city walls in the present by addressing, among others, the following questions:

● Are there local, regional, and national trends in archaeological research on city walls (and infrastructure in general)?

● Are city walls a priority in choosing sites? Are certain time periods given priority?

● Is research on city walls only driven from above (i.e. by new infrastructure development and state-sponsored tourism), or does some of it come from below?

● Can digital technologies facilitate local, regional, and global comparative investigations of material remains of city walls?

Panel 2:Materiality and communication(14.00-17.00)

Andrea Mubi Brighenti and Mattias Kärrhold, in their introduction toUrban Walls: Political and Cultural Meanings of Vertical Structures and Surfaces(2018),refer to walls asmaterial and semiotic technologies of inter- visibility managementand walling as atechnology of social interaction. In archaeological interpretations, city walls delineate ingroups and outgroups; they demonstrate seemingly clear borders between past and present regimes. In recent years the renewed interest in city walls as tourist attractions has made it so that city walls everywhere are treated as local/national symbols. City walls create bonds and barriers to this day; they are sources of safety and alienation, and in recent years walls are a source of revenue through tourism. They also influence city planning and community relations. This panel explores how city walls create social relations by examining, among others, the following questions:

● How are memories of city walls transmitted? What is the role of city walls in inculcating culture (generatinghabitus)?

● How are experiences of the materiality of city walls reflected in archaeological finds of different groups?

● How do city walls mediate the relationship between the sacred and the profane?

● How have city walls enabled infrastructural violence and inequality in the past? Do they have an impact on violence and inequality today?

● How can archaeological research into the materiality of city walls help us understand and address contemporary teichopolitics?

Deadline for abstracts (up to 200 words):December 1, 2023.

        ALTERNATIVE HYGIENIC MODERNITY: CHINESE MEDICAL THERAPY PROJECT FOR INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION IN COLD WAR TAIWAN
      </h3></div><div><p class="text-gray-800 text-sm">

        The concept of Hygienic Modernity has been proposed for about 20 years. This talk takes the Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) poisoning event in Taiwan in the Cold War period as an example to revisit this well-known concept in the modern history of East Asia. The PCBs are incurable industrial toxicants and have caused environmental pollution and food poisoning from the U.S. to East Asia since the 1970s. I argue that this pollution in Taiwan was a transformative point when industrial toxicants became modern hygienic issues, and the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine treatments for PCBs became a new kind of modernity in the 1980s. Moreover, the Kuomintang (KMT) government constructed this integrated therapeutic method to tackle the hygienic and societal disorders caused by Western industrial modernity.

In the late period of the Cold War, difficult political situations at home and abroad posed the KMT government with numerous social movements in Taiwan. During the outbreak of PCBs poisonings and the following grassroots consumerism campaigns, Li-Fu Chen, an influential KMT politician, promoted the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine for PCBs therapy beneath the official propaganda of the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Movement (1966-1991). Interdisciplinary teams conducted both animal experiments and clinical trials to validate the therapeutic effectiveness of this project. Although the long-term outcome of Chinese medicine treatment was unsatisfactory, this project benefited the KMT government’s three political goals: alleviated societal panic, propagated Taiwan’s medical achievements to the West, and institutionalized the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine.

        China’s global engagement with countries in the developing world is rapidly evolving in an era where traditional aid discourses and the practices of emerging powers in international development are undergoing significant changes. As the largest South-South cooperation provider and the world’s second-largest economy, China’s development activities overseas have sparked debates regarding its role as a rising power in international development and its implications for the post-liberal global order. Over the past few decades, China has substantially diversified its instruments and infrastructure in development practices. While some view China as a catalyst for new models of development and growth, others accuse China of being responsible for the debt crises faced by many recipient economies. China’s involvement in international development has led to wide-ranging impacts.

This seminar series invites experts from five continents to engage in a three-part discussion on the instruments, finance, and infrastructures of China’s international development. In the first part, we explore the evolution and diversification of instruments in China’s international development practices, including its deployment of foreign aid and development finance, as well as its evolving role in international security arrangements and global economic governance institutions. In part two, we delve into the composition of Chinese development finance, comparing it to the World Bank, and examine how the Global South perceives its local impact. In part three, we take China’s global infrastructure engagement as an example to illustrate the different actors and approaches involved in China’s international development practices, as well as the role of state-led development. Using the three panel discussions, we illustrate the wide-ranging impacts of Chinese international development engagement at the local, national, and global levels.

        On Wednesday, April 24 from 3:30 to 5pm in THO 317 and online, the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Wendy Cheng to discuss her newest book entitledIsland X:Taiwanese Student Migrants, Campus Spies, and Cold War Activism.Wendy delves into the compelling political lives of Taiwanese migrants who came to the United States as students from the 1960s through the 1980s. Often depicted as compliant model minorities, many were in fact deeply political, shaped by Taiwan’s colonial history and influenced by the global social movements of their time.

Drawing on interviews with student activists and extensive archival research, Wendy Cheng documents how Taiwanese Americans developed tight-knit social networks as infrastructures for identity formation, consciousness development, and anticolonial activism. Raising questions about historical memory and Cold War circuits of power, Island X is a testament to the lives and advocacy of a generation of Taiwanese American activists.

Wendy Chengis a Professor of American Studies at Scripps College. She received her A.B. from Harvard University in English and American Language and Literature, her M.A. in Geography from UC Berkeley, and her Ph.D. in American Studies and Ethnicity from the University of Southern California. She is the author of The Changs Next Door to the Díazes: Remapping Race in Suburban California (University of Minnesota Press, 2013), which won the 2014 Book Award from the American Sociological Association’s Section on Asia and Asian America, and coauthor of A People’s Guide to Los Angeles (University of California Press, 2012), which won the Association of American Geographers’ Globe Book Award for Public Understanding of Geography and the SCIBA Nonfiction Award.
