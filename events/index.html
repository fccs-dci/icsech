        HOW DOMESTIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL POLITICS SHAPE CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

        A conversation between Prof William Hurst and Prof Pete Gries on how both domestic and foreign policy shapes China in IR.

Most international relations scholarship ignores or oversimplifies the role of domestic politics. Conversely, most analysis of domestic politics, even in reference to the making and implementation of foreign policy, downplays or occludes the influence of international factors. Only by looking at the two in tandem can we make significant headway. Ruling governing coalitions make foreign policy largely to advance domestic political aims and agendas, but they do so in international structural environments that incentivise and constrain their strategies and behaviour.

By looking at China’s relationships with the United States and several Southeast Asian countries over time, I propose a theory of interaction between domestic and international factors to explain the dynamics of Chinese foreign policy and international relations more broadly.

        Labor unions have recently reappeared in news headlines in Japan and the US as both countries recognize a need to improve employee wages, benefits, and working conditions. However, there is a striking fundamental difference between the two countries. US law requires a majority of employees to support union representation before a company is required to negotiate with the union. That results in high-profile unionization campaigns like those taking place at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks stores. By contrast, employers in Japan must bargain in good faith with minority unions, sometimes more than one at a workplace. How does this affect unionization and collective bargaining, and what are the implications for the future of labor markets in Japan and the US? Two leading experts on labor law, Professor Hiroya Nakakubo of Hitotsubashi University and Professor Alan Hyde of Rutgers Law School, will join NYU Law Adjunct Professor Bruce Aronson in discussion.

The trend of this burgeoning tech industry outside of Silicon Valley and increase of megatech companies and startups is derived from a trust in the Midwest and increased global investment in the inland region. How does the Heartland capitalize on this nationwide transition inward? What does this mean for Heartland residents and what economic and innovation policies can we expect?

Join USHCA for our second event in our Authors Series this year, as we invite Rebecca A. Fannin to discuss her latest book “Silicon Heartland: Transforming the Midwest from Rust Belt to Tech Belt.” Originally from the Heartland region, Rebecca also has covered Asia in three prior books including Tech Titans of China, and has spoken on many major news outlets as an expert on Asia’s entrepreneurial boom. She has an established career in journalism as a CNBC contributor and in 2010, launched the media platform Silicon Dragon Ventures. Her new book, “Silicon Heartland”, recounts the roots of her own journey ─ and also brings explores our region’s comeback from the Rust Belt to a Tech Belt. The event will also feature moderator Dan Schwartz, a past publisher of AVCJ in Hong Kong, author of The Future of Finance, and currently a member of the Band of Angels in Silicon Valley. He previously served as Nevada State Treasurer from 2015 to 2019.

        GOING SOLO: CHINA’S ‘SINGLES ECONOMY’ AND THE DATE-RENTING INDUSTRY

        China has witnessed a rising number of singles in recent years, including the unmarried, divorced and widowed. The number of people who live alone is also on the rise, especially in cosmopolitan cities and coastal areas. This rising single population gave rise to an emerging ‘singles economy’ (danshen jingji), marked by growing demand for mini-apartments for solo dwellers, appliances for one-person households, food delivery services tailored to ‘singletons’, tour packages for single men and women, companion pets, and boyfriend and girlfriend-renting services.

I will unpack China’s growing ‘singles economy’ through a case study of the date-renting industry, which has become a thriving part of the Chinese economy. Through analysis of various date-renting websites and drawing on the theories that focused on the intersection of romance/emotions and the market/capitalism, I identify the logic of the date-renting industry and the gendered strategic presentation of ‘date-traders’ online. I argue that the boundary between emotions and capitalism has become increasingly blurred as these two seemingly opposing forces are converging, constituting a unique phenomenon in China’s singles economy. This manifests as an economically moulded dating culture intertwined with new, intricate social and personal relations – a by-product of China’s demographic shifts and rapidly growing market economy.

        THE OPIUM BUSINESS: A HISTORY OF CRIME AND CAPITALISM IN MARITIME CHINA

        From its rise in the 1830s to its pinnacle in the 1930s, the opium trade was a guiding force in the Chinese political economy. Opium money was inextricably bound up in local, national, and imperial finances, and the people who piloted the trade were integral to the fabric of Chinese society. In this book, Peter Thilly narrates the dangerous lives and shrewd business operations of opium traffickers in southeast China, situating them within a global history of capitalism. By tracing the evolution of the opium trade from clandestine offshore agreements in the 1830s, to multi-million dollar prohibition bureau contracts in the 1930s, Thilly demonstrates how the modernizing Chinese state was infiltrated, manipulated, and profoundly transformed by opium profiteers. Opium merchants carried the drug by sea, over mountains, and up rivers, with leading traders establishing monopolies over trade routes and territories and assembling &quot;opium armies&quot; to protect their businesses. Over time, and as their ranks grew, these organizations became more bureaucratized and militarized, mimicking—and then eventually influencing, infiltrating, or supplanting—the state. Through the chaos of revolution, warlordism, and foreign invasion, opium traders diligently expanded their power through corruption, bribery, and direct collaboration with the state. Drug traders mattered—not only in the seedy ways in which they have been caricatured but also crucially as shadowy architects of statecraft and China's evolution on the world stage.

        The Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984 and transferred control of Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China from 1 July 1997. This set the scene for the establishment of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) in Hong Kong. Lim uses British archival sources to re-examine the Joint Declaration, the negotiations that led up to it and its resounding significance. Beginning with Margaret Thatcher’s preparations for her Beijing trip, his recent book, Treaty for a Lost City: The Sino-British Joint Declaration (Cambridge University Press, 2022) takes a chronological approach. In light of current developments, Lim will set out to explain some of the legal complexities that have underpinned the relationships between China, Hong Kong and Britain since 1979.

        This talk introducesImperial Gateway, which explores the political, social, and economic significance of colonial Taiwan in the southern expansion of Japan's empire from 1895 to the end of World War II. The book uncovers a half century of dynamic relations between Japan, Taiwan, China, and Western regional powers. Japanese officials in Taiwan did not simply take orders from Tokyo; rather, they often pursued their own expansionist ambitions in South China and Southeast Asia. When outright conquest was not possible, they promoted alternative strategies, including naturalizing resident Chinese as overseas Taiwanese subjects, extending colonial police networks, and deploying tens of thousands of Taiwanese to war. The Taiwanese—merchants, gangsters, policemen, interpreters, nurses, and soldiers—seized new opportunities for socioeconomic advancement that did not always align with Japan's imperial interests.Imperial Gatewayshows how Japanese officials and Taiwanese subjects transformed Taiwan into a regional gateway for expansion in an ever-shifting international order.

        To a lively cast of international players that shaped Manchuria during the early twentieth century, At the Frontier of God’s Empire adds a new perspective through the remarkable personal archive of Alfred Marie Caubrière (1876–1948). A French Catholic missionary, Caubrière arrived in Manchuria on the eve of the Boxer Uprising in 1899 and was murdered on the eve of the birth of the People’s Republic of China in 1948. Living with ordinary Chinese people for half a century, Caubrière’s documentation opens a unique window into everyday interaction between Manchuria’s grassroots society and various international players. His gripping accounts personalize the interplay of missions and empire in local society and illuminate vital issues in modern Chinese history, such as mass migration and religion, tensions between church and state, and the importance of cross-cultural exchanges in everyday life in Chinese Catholic communities. This intense transformation of Manchurian local society embodies the clash of both domestic and international tensions in the making of modern China.

In the 1980s, Japan’s economic growth represented up to a quarter of the world’s annual GDP growth. Much of Japan’s growth was tied to an extraordinary growth in property markets. By 1990, residential land prices in Tokyo and Osaka were nearly three times what they were in 1985, Japanese property taken together was valued at four times the value of real estate in the US, and real estate and construction were contributing over a fifth of Japan’s GDP. In 1991, Japan’s real estate growth came to a halt. As China addresses bubbles and financial risks in its real estate sector, could China’s economy face similar outcomes? What can China learn from the path of the real estate sector in Japan?

Please join experts on Japan's and China's financial systems and real estate sectors for this discussion. The event features Paul Sheard and Takeo Hoshi discussing factors around the rise and fall of Japan’s property market in the 1980s and 1990s and how Japan could have differently managed its real estate boom and crisis, and Wei Xiong discussing parallels and differences with conditions in China.

This event is the third in a series on China’s real estate sector and its broader economic effects. For a recording of the previous session, please seehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Fx-G4PaUs.

        Standard narratives of the Chinese past present &quot;China&quot; as a continuous entity since ancient times, attaining its current territorial shape through cultural osmosis rather than military force, and presiding over a peaceful, hierarchical and Sinocentric system of Asian states maintained through Confucian deference. This vision has been promoted by Chinese governments, but it is also commonplace in survey courses, textbooks and popular culture produced outside of China, especially in the Anglophone world, and is even routinely referenced by politicians and diplomats from the US. It is also patently wrong, as anyone who has ever read any Chinese history knows: wars and conquest have been no less common in China and East Asia than anywhere else; modern migrations by Chinese into &quot;frontiers&quot; backed by state power have displaced indigenous peoples in ways reminiscent of European settler colonialism in the Americas, and the legacy of this expansion remains problematic decades after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in the territory of the former Qing empire. This lecture will examine how three key concepts in the historiography of China, &quot;Sinicization,&quot; the &quot;tribute system&quot; and &quot;Chinese dynasties,&quot; have ingrained and perpetuated an inaccurate exceptionalism in how we talk about the past and present of peoples and states in geographical China.

        Economic history requires the use of numbers and units. Nevertheless, numbers and units themselves as recorded in Chinese historical sources could be problematic, due to misprints and copyists’ errors, variations in weights and measures, different institutional settings, as well as others. A universal solution in theory is very likely to be improbable if not impossible. This talk, studying grain prices in the Mongol Yuan dynasty, roughly from 1260 to 1350, intends to approach these challenges in a pragmatic and practical way. By contextualizing price numbers in multiple dimensions, I hope that the degree of consistency among numbers could be at least partially clarified, and that relatively more acceptable data series could be built. This talk will first give a brief introduction to the primary sources, then devote length to discussions on three key common issues: (1) institutional settings of original numbers, (2) official and local units of capacity, and (3) types and varieties of grain. After that, an overall presentation of price data will be given with some supplementary remarks. In conclusion, I will briefly outline some implications of the newly developed data series for further studies.

S﻿peaker's Bio:

Li Chunyuan is an Associate Professor at the Department of History, Xiamen University, China, and currently a Harvard-Yenching visiting scholar at Harvard University. He received his Bachelor degree in Economics in 2006 from Fudan University, China, then received his Doctoral Degree in History in 2014 also from Fudan University. Since 2013, he has been a visiting fellow or a visiting scholar at Tübingen University in Germany, The Academy of Korean Studies in South Korea, and Hongkong University of Science and Technology.

His research focuses on the historical transition of China from 1150 to 1450 with an emphasis on the Mongol-Yuan era, addressing questions of two dimensions: 1) how nomadic and sedentary cultures interacted with and adapted to each other in the Yuan period; and 2) how the Mongol Yuan period had reshaped Chinese traditions since Song-Liao-Jin and therefore laid a new foundation for later dynasties.

So far, he has published more than thirty journal articles. They concern mainly two areas. One is the economic situation under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, such as fiscal practices, salt monopolies, and market economies. He published a series of articles on prices under the Yuan dynasty, including land price, grain price, salt price, as well as interest rates. The other area of concern is the political dynamics in Yuan China, such as the transition of the Koryǒ-Mongol relations around 1260, the perception of the Chinese dynastic title Da Yuan among various cultural groups.

Currently, he is working on a framework for interpreting the extant scant primary sources on grain prices in Yuan China, trying to make use of those unsystematic, randomly recorded numbers and to piece together some useful data series.

        In this timely and illuminating talk, Dr Bates Gill will discuss the principal themes of his new book,Daring to Struggle: China's Global Ambitions under Xi Jinping(Oxford University Press, 2022). Drawing from the book's findings, Dr Gill will explain the fundamental motivations driving China's more dynamic, assertive and risk-taking approach to the world under Xi Jinping. InDaring to Struggle, Gill focuses on six increasingly important interests for today's China — legitimacy, sovereignty, wealth, power, leadership, and ideas — and details how the determined pursuit of these goals at home and abroad profoundly shapes its foreign relationships, for better and for worse. The result is a more contested strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

        COAL CONSUMPTION IN CHINA: A REVIEW OF PLANS FOR DECARBONISATION AND AN OUTLOOK ON IMPORT DEMAND

        China’s consumption of coal has made headlines in the media over the past few years for several reasons. Its covid-stimulus spending was largely directed towards smokestack industries, pushing emissions up. Xi Jinping quite unexpectedly announced China had set itself a net-zero emissions target by 2026, with emissions peaking before 2030. Political tensions led to China imposing an embargo on imports of Australian coal. And in two consecutive years, parts of China suffered power supply shortages. This seminar will present analysis done using the Installation-level China Coal Model, one of the world’s most granular models of China’s coal sector. This will be focused on developments in domestic demand, production, and transport infrastructure for coal, and the resulting effects on Chinese demand for imported coal. These results will be connected with news on the covid-stimulus, net-zero target, the embargo, and power generation crises, and given context with a review of key policies for decarbonisation.

A big focus in this work has been the renewable energy industries, or understanding why some countries manage to develop strong R&amp;amp;D or industrial capabilities, and whether this depends on country characteristics, technology characteristics, or policy design. In his current position at the Crawford School of Public Policy, Jorrit works on energy transitions more generally. Here he has led the development of one of the world’s most granular transport models of China’s coal sector, which is currently being expanded to cover the Asia-Pacific region, and the iron and steel sector.

        In this webinar, Dr Chao-Yo Cheng examines China's administrative courts' success. For decades, it has remained difficult for Chinese citizens to challenge government decisions through administrative litigation, as local governments control the crucial fiscal and personnel resources of the courts. In 2014, the Supreme People's Court announced the decision to allow the newly integrated railway transport courts (RTCs) to accept and hear administrative cases. Unlike the local people's courts (LPCs), the RTCs are under the direct administration of the provincial high courts. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 238,000 first-instance judgment records between 2015 and 2019, we study whether the RTCs' incorporation into the adjudication of administrative cases has improved Chinese citizens' chances of winning their cases.

Following multivariate regression analysis, Dr Cheng and colleagues (2022) discovered that only at the primary level are the RTCs more likely than the LPCs to side with citizens. Moreover, the primary RTCs' pro-plaintiff effect becomes statistically insignificant when the cases concerned are filed against government agencies from higher administrative levels. We also find suggestive evidence indicating provincial governments' implicit influence over the RTCs. Overall, China's experiment of administrative courts has achieved a partial success. The RTCs' leverage to evade the capture by local government agencies may remain constrained given their embeddedness in the current Chinese political system.

        What would development look like if its practitioners and scholars were ‘against NGOs,’ challenging common sense about them? This book presents a critical perspective on NGOs, describing how they emerged as key agents of development over time. Through an interpretative history based on Gramscian concepts it shows how civil society organizations were gradually enlisted in development as non-state technocratic actors. The book argues that management studies and development studies emerged as commonsensical explanations for capitalist crises. Each offered complementary solutions to balance the needs of capital and society, in particular historical circumstances. These solutions also situated civil society as agents of development and vectors of management. Against NGOs fills a gap within the literature of management and development studies through its original discussion of their historical interconnections and shared themes. The book raises provocative questions on what forms of knowledge-politics can respond productively to the crises of our contemporary moment.

        IR scholars often define prestige as “reputation for power” and argue for its significance in the context of high-stakes negotiations, the dynamics of power transition, or (bi-polar) competition to attract allies and partners. Famously, Giplin argued that for international relations prestige is “enormously important” – even more so than power itself. This is because “if your strength is recognized, you can generally achieve your aims without having to use it.” But whereas Giplin and others correctly conceptualize the power of prestige in driving desired outcomes, there is yet little attention to what exactly it means for strength to be “recognized,” and who is doing the recognizing.

Drawing on the “visual turn” in IR and starting from the original (visual) connotation of prestige as “dazzling influence” and “glamour,” this talk interrogates the links between prestige and recognition from the vantage point of the politics of aesthetics. For the purpose, I turn to select cases linked to China’s bid for international prestige, especially based on the invocation of common (Silk Road) past and shared future. I show how, in different communities, visual representations and public displays disrupt standard formulations of a shared (Silk Road) past and also bring forth alternative understandings of the meaning and work of prestige. These cases, I suggest, can help clarify not only the important links between power and recognition, but can also showcase the need for critical exploration of prestige in relation to empire and ontologies of power, the complexities of post-colonial order, and the evolving spaces for political agency.

        The growing economic and political relationships between China and the African continent in the past two decades are well documented in social science and policy studies. As Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt-and-Road initiative continues to expand China’ global reach, pushback has resulted from the spread of Covid-19 and African governments’ increasing debt to the Chinese government. These developments raise new geopolitical questions now that other parts of the world and China are “decoupling.” State actors continue to occupy analytical mindsets.

Siu complicates the land-based, state-centered conceptual frameworks by highlighting the historical legacies and contemporary fluidities that make up the life worlds of multi-ethnic stakeholders who have long traversed the continental divides. Based on ethnographic trips in Tanzania, the Gulf Region, South and Southeast Asia, Guangdong and Hong Kong, Siu uncovers crucial layers of maritime connections and explores how diverse human encounters, their nuanced cultural meanings and intense powerplay are expressed.

        Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s



Book Talk with Chien-Wen Kung (National University of Singapore) 



O﻿nline Event 



*﻿RSVP requested

The UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Chien-Wen Kung to discuss his newly published monograph, Diasporic Cold Warriors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Philippine Chinese were Southeast Asia and possibly the world’s most exemplary overseas Chinese Cold Warriors. Fears of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Southeast Asia’s Chinese as conduits for PRC influence gripped states and societies then – as indeed they do today. Yet, ironically, the example of the Philippines shows that the &quot;China&quot; which intervened the most extensively in any Southeast Asian country during the Cold War was not the PRC. It was, rather, the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. Drawing upon archival research and fieldwork in Taiwan, the Philippines, the United States, and China, Diasporic Cold Warriors tells for the first time this story of the Philippine Chinese as anticommunist partisans by tracing their evolving relationship with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Philippine state over the middle third of the 20th century.

Chien-Wen Kung is an Assistant Professor of History at the National University of Singapore and the author of Diasporic Cold Warriors: Nationalist China, Anticommunism, and the Philippine Chinese, 1930s-1970s. His scholarship has also been published in Modern Asian Studies, the International History Review, and Asian Ethnicity. Born and raised in Singapore, he received his B.A. in History and English from Dartmouth College and Ph.D. in Modern Chinese and International and Global History from Columbia University. With funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and National Heritage Board in Singapore, he is currently working on a cultural history of Singapore-China-Taiwan relations in the 1970s and 1980s.

        In this talk, Silvia Lindtner,Associate Professor in the School ofInformation andPenny W Stamps School of Art and Design at the Univesrity of Michiganwill draw from ethnographic research she has conducted over the last 14 months across two sites in China: 1) small-scale businesses that center on alternative food and spiritual practices via life in nature and the countryside and 2) large-scale, data-driven agricultural experiments at the outskirts of major urban centers. Prof. Lindtner will discuss how these two sites interact for the implementation of two recent state policies on “rural revitalization” and “national strengthening.” These policies are aimed at reinvesting into China’s “hinterlands:” from rural farmland to people’s most inner selves. They position data-driven techniques of automation, surveillance technology, and smart systems as key to the state’s ability to manage life that has partially escaped the state’s reach. And they call upon China’s youths who have turned away from the city to live and work in China’s countryside to co-produce what she calls “data engines,” i.e. a participatory form of techno-governance driven by an engineering mindset that aims to cultivate citizens as productive selves who operate on behalf of the party state and its ambition to build a “strong China” by turning inwards—China’s history, soil, and agriculture. Data engines, she shows, simultaneously enable, and slow down the automation of China’s soil and soul.

        The King’s Road offers a new interpretation of the history of the Silk Road, emphasizing its importance as a diplomatic route, rather than a commercial one. Tracing the arduous journeys of diplomatic envoys, Xin Wen presents a rich social history of long-distance travel that played out in deserts, post stations, palaces, and polo fields. The book tells the story of the everyday lives of diplomatic travelers on the Silk Road—what they ate and drank, the gifts they carried, and the animals that accompanied them—and how they navigated a complex web of geographic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. It also describes the risks and dangers envoys faced along the way—from financial catastrophe to robbery and murder. Using documents unearthed from the famous Dunhuang “library cave” in Western China, The King’s Road paints a detailed picture of the intricate network of trans-Eurasian transportation and communication routes that was established between 850 and 1000 CE.

By exploring the motivations of the kings who dispatched envoys along the Silk Road and describing the transformative social and economic effects of their journeys, the book reveals the inner workings of an interstate network distinct from the Sino-centric “tributary” system. In shifting the narrative of the Silk Road from the transport of commodities to the exchange of diplomatic gifts and personnel, The King’s Road puts the history of Eastern Eurasia in a new light.

        In this talk, India China Institute’s Postdoctoral Fellow Sarandha Jain will discuss her PhD dissertation, which studies the oil-mediated relationship between the Indian state and citizens. Focusing on both oil production and consumption, presenting ethnography of oil refineries, research institutes, state offices, a peri-urban working-class-neighborhood near Delhi, and ‘black markets’, her talk examines oil as an infrastructure for the state and for society. She argues that the Indian state distributes itself into citizens’ lives via petroleum products, which obtain their sociopolitical agencies while being produced in certain ways, and play out those agencies while being consumed in certain ways. Her ethnography of refineries details out the microprocesses of oil refining and the complex relationship that human and nonhuman actors share. It elaborates on how politics get programmed into petroleum products, designed to discipline consumer-citizens into particular lifestyles, and how varying actors encumber this. Research on oil consumption with ‘black-marketeers’ and ordinary consumers of petroleum products, probes “distorted discipline”, where governmental plans get mangled by the informal practices of state actors as well as citizens. How does the politics programmed into petroleum products in refineries actually play out once other actors intervene, and snatch control over oil away from the state? Investigating this tussle between legalized and illegalized groups, she describes how it structures citizens’ lives, and the constellations of power and forms of sociality it gives rise to. This talk highlights the constant churning between the state and citizens through ever-evolving devices of government, as well as through escape from them. Specific modes of subjectification, engineered through flows of oil, lie at the heart of this churning, over which state-citizen formations are negotiated.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	Relationships with bureaucracies, commercial counterparts and civil society in host countries
	
	Communist party influence on organisational structure, style of operating and incentive and penalties for employees.
	
	How Chinese companies manage the complexities of operating in international environments including language, host country markets, unfamiliar political systems, and cultural milieus as well as with competition from other commercial entities.
	
	Case studies of particular Chinese companies operating abroad, or conversely, a range of Chinese companies operating in a particular host country.


The publishing outcomes of this conference will include a special issue proposal toThe China Journal.
