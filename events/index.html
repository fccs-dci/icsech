        The Hoover Project on China’s Global Sharp Power invites you to Cadre Country: How China became the Chinese Communist Party China’s communist party regards itself as engaged in a global information war. In his new book, Cadre Country, historian John Fitzgerald probes some of the key stories the party tells to advance its cause. In this talk, he focuses on one story that resonates in China and internationally, China’s ‘Century of Humiliation.’ Where does this term come from, when it is deployed, and why?

        Chinese poetry has a long history of interaction with the visual arts. Classical aesthetic thought held that painting, calligraphy, and poetry were cross-fertilizing and mutually enriching. What happened when the Chinese poetic tradition encountered photography, a transformative technology and presumably realistic medium that reshaped seeing and representing the world?

Shengqing Wu explores how the new medium of photography was transformed by Chinese aesthetic culture. She details the complex negotiations between poetry and photography in the late Qing and early Republican eras, examining the ways traditional textual forms collaborated with the new visual culture. Drawing on extensive archival research into illustrated magazines, poetry collections, and vintage photographs, Photo Poetics analyzes a wide range of practices and genres, including self-representation in portrait photography; gifts of inscribed photographs; mass-media circulation of images of beautiful women; and photography of ghosts, immortals, and imagined landscapes. Wu argues that the Chinese lyrical tradition provided rich resources for artistic creativity, self-expression, and embodied experience in the face of an increasingly technological and image-oriented society. An interdisciplinary study spanning literary studies, visual culture, and media history, Photo Poetics is an original account of media culture in early twentieth-century China and the formation of Chinese literary and visual modernities.

        FUNNY MONEY CIRCULATION AND FABRIC EXPORTS FROM CHINA TO DUBAI THROUGH INDIAN TRADING NETWORKS

        Chiefly drawing on his ethnographic fieldwork in the district of Keqiao in Zhejiang Province since 2009, Dr. Cheuk argues that irregular financial transactions — conceptualized as “funny money” in this talk — play a significant role in the sustenance of otherwise tenuous business relations between Indian traders and Chinese suppliers in the China–Dubai fabric trade. Much of the fabric exported from Keqiao to Dubai relies on intertwined formal and informal transactions operated by Indian trading networks. These labyrinthine transnational funny money transactions aim to circumvent institutional hurdles and overcome deficiencies in operating capital, yet inherent to this system is a cycle of payment lags that cause tense relations between payers and payees. Funny money transactions facilitate eventual payment in most cases most of the time and maintain enough trust to keep the trade network alive. Furthermore, the interlocking circuits of funny money also prevent the overaccumulation of wealth and power by any particular stakeholder involved in the international trade and defy or at least circumvent the formal political authority of state and financial institutions that seek to curtail such practices. These transactions thereby create a larger space for business survival among the grassroots players, especially Indian traders who may not have enough capital available when they initiate a deal with a Chinese supplier.

        This talk builds on recent scholarship that takes seriously fantasmatic portrayals of transmutation in Chinese porcelain manufacture. The speaker argues that creative accounts—theatrical and narrative, Chinese and European—position porcelain as a substance hovering on the cusp between life and death, person and thing, animate and inanimate. To do so, she will take you through Chinese materials as diverse as a Ming court opera about the eunuch admiral Zheng He, strange cases of statues that haunt, hagiographies of self-sacrificing artisans who immolate themselves in the kiln, and a stop-motion animation film comprised entirely of porcelain by contemporary artist Geng Xue. The catalyst for the project is the recent performance in New York and Chicago of an 18th century French pantomime-ballet about an evil sorcerer who transforms people into porcelain. This brilliant new production, co-created by art historian Meredith Martin and the choreographer and Asian American activist Phil Chan, reimagines a work from the height of the European chinoiserie craze in a way that both captures the magic of porcelain and addresses current politics of race in the arts for a 21st century audience.

        Over the last decades, China has punished countries that undermine its territorial claims and foreign policy goals with measures such as restricting trade, encouraging popular boycotts, and cutting off tourism. These coercive measures have caused significant economic damage to U.S. partners such as Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea. China’s economic sanctions may also have long-term effects in deterring and shaping countries’ foreign policy interests that go well beyond the short-term economic costs. The talk will highlight how Taiwan responds to China’s economic sanctions. It demonstrates the agency of medium-sized countries in the shadow of a great power The second part of this presentation offers initial thoughts on establishing a trade pact in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s unilateral economic sanctions. More specifically, Taiwan and Australia have much to offer the rest of the world regarding how to respond to China’s economic coercion.

        Cabo-Verde-China relations have rapidly developed in the last two decades. China has provided a lot of assistance to this small archipelagic nation located in the Atlantic Ocean, around 400 kilometres west of the Africa continent. Several Chinese companies, including Huawei, are active there. A Confucius Institute has been opened in Praia, the country's capital, and the Chinese government has built and donated a brand new campus to the University of Cabo Verde. Yet, Cabo Verde remains closer to the West, both the United States, which for security reasons is worried about China's inroads, and the European Union which has for a long time established a close partnership with this former Portuguese colony. This presentation will show that small and weak states as Cabo Verde can still enjoy some agency in their relations with great powers, an agency that allows them to balance their relationships and optimise their interests.

        In 2009 the UN, the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC), the Chinese Government and representatives of over a thousand Daoist temples, monasteries and organisations met at the ancient sacred site of Hua Shan. There, the Daoists launched their first eight year plan to combat climate change, address bio-diversity issues and work for a sustainable environment. This event also launched a totally unique way in which Daoism expresses why the forces driving climate change are fundamentally wrong - a view which was later taken up by the UN. It also launched a whole series of practical actions across China - guided, enabled and inspired by Daoism.

In the most recent Five Year Plan of China, the Daoists have been given a central role in civil society programmes on environmental education and action – the first time any faith has been highlighted in any of the Five Year Plans. And later this year a new eight-year Daoist plan will be launched. Martin Palmer, former Secretary General of ARC, religious advisor to HRH The Duke of Edinburgh for 35 years and now CEO of FaithInvest as well as being one of the world’s leading translators of Chinese classics, has worked with the Daoists on environmental issues since 1993.

Martin Palmerwas the Secretary General of the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC) until June 2019. ARC was founded with HRH Prince Philip in 1995 to help faiths develop environmental and conservation projects based on their own beliefs and practices. Although ARC closed in 2019, having achieved its major goals, its legacy includes FaithInvest and WWF's International Beliefs and Values Programme. Martin is an international specialist on all major faiths and religious traditions and cultures. He is the author and editor of more than 20 books on religious and environmental topics. He has translated many ancient Chinese texts, is a regular contributor to the BBC, and is a lay preacher in the Church of England

        “The funeral home was like his second office.” On average, a Taiwanese MP receives 31 requests a week from constituents to attend funerals. Why are voters interested in having MPs present at private funerals? Drawing on evidence from in-depth interviews and observation, this study focuses on the role of guanxi, the Chinese term for particularistic ties. Voters in a guanxi society are inclined to show off their particularistic ties with Very Important People. Since national lawmakers are figures of power, this tendency among voters keeps Taiwanese legislators exceptionally busy attending private weddings, funerals, and banquets, often at the expense of attentiveness to national policy. The study concludes that guanxi culture brings constituency focus to the fore of Taiwan’s political representation, shedding some light on the ramification of political culture on democratic consolidation.

Across sub-Saharan Africa, China has burst on to the scene as a leading partner. Although this affords African nations rich opportunities, it also exposes them to the risks of authoritarian sharp power and makes the conditions for democracy in the region more challenging. Where are the red flags? And how can African nations engage with China while safeguarding their sovereignty and advancing good governance, development, and democracy?

Panel 1: Climate Governance and the Rule of Law

The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that the damage to Earth’s ecosystems from rising temperatures is mounting far more rapidly than the global community has been able to respond – at least, so far. With an updated and comprehensive climate treaty seemingly out of reach, what are other options for mobilizing action? Our expert panel, which includes two authors of the upcoming IPCC Working Group III report, will discuss the prospects for alternative approaches including multilayered efforts at the level of regional groups of states, domestic governments, and sub-national governments, as well as pursuing agreements on single issues, in single sectors, or among non-state actors such as businesses.

        Rising sea levels due to climate change are affecting the livelihoods of millions of persons in Asia-Pacific. While engineers develop physical adaptations, the UN’s International Law Commission (ICL) has been studying needed adaptations to international legal frameworks in order to protect the status and rights of affected states. Rising sea levels will change boundaries, force some populations to move to artificial islands, and could leave some small island nations without territory at all.

        East Asian higher education has common cultural roots in Chinese civilization, each country has been shaped in different ways by Western intervention, and all are building global strategies. Shared educational agendas combine with long political tensions and rising national identities. Hope and fear touch each other. What are the prospects for regional harmony-in-diversity? How do internationalization and indigenization interplay in higher education in this remarkable and brilliant region, once overshadowed by Western power and now coming back into its own, where so much of the future of humanity will be decided?

These issues are addressed in a new book from the Centre for Global Higher Education,Changing Higher Education in East Asia, edited by Simon Marginson and Xin Xu. The book brings together experts from Australia, China mainland, Hong KongSAR, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK and Vietnam. Their chapters add new strands to the academic conversation about higher education in East Asia. Issues covered include the role of higher education in furthering the global public and common good in different national contexts, world citizenship education, the internationalization of the humanities and social sciences, geopolitics and higher education development, cross-border academic mobility, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on regional student mobility, and future regionalization in East Asia.

In thisCGHEwebinar Simon Marginson and Xin Xu will introduce the book, and Olga Mun and Yunkyung Min discuss their chapter. ‘Global Public Good in Korea as Jeong’. A Q&amp;amp;A session will follow that will be chaired by Ka Ho Mok, who also contributed a chapter to this book, ‘The Covid-19 Pandemic and International Higher Education in East Asia’.

Panel 3: US-Japan Partnership in Climate Change

Discussions of US-Japanese cooperation often focus on geopolitics and trade. This panel will examine the ways in which the two governments, working separately and together, have shaped the global architecture for addressing climate change. Tomoaki Ishigaki, a minister at the Embassy of Japan to the United States, and Pete Ogden, vice president for energy, climate, and the environment at the United Nations Foundation, will explain how the US and Japan have interacted with each other and other major players in climate negotiations, analyze the dynamics between domestic constraints and international action, and suggest areas for closer cooperation to address the accelerating global crisis. Bruce Aronson will moderate the discussion.

What is the relationship between internal development and integration into the global economy in developing countries? How and why do state–market relations differ? And do these differences matter in the post-cold war era of global conflict and cooperation? Drawing on research in China, India, and Russia and examining sectors from textiles to telecommunications, Micro-institutional Foundations of Capitalism introduces a new theory of sectoral pathways to globalization and development. Roselyn Hsueh is an associate professor of political science at Temple University, where she co-directs the Certificate in Political Economy.

States take the center stage at global climate negotiations, but corporations sit squarely in the crosshairs as contributors to climate change, casualties of the fallout, and indispensable participants in any response. Governments, investors, and publics across Asia-Pacific are increasingly demanding that corporations do more to address the climate crisis. Jennifer G.

Literary imaginations about modern China are often synonymous with imaginations about “new people.” This talk focuses on how such imaginations unfolded and evolved in 20th-century Chinese science fiction. In particular, it calls attention to the dynamic interaction between translation and creation, and to the genre’s close engagement with ongoing ideological and literary debates within the national context. Jing Jiang is Associate Professor of Chinese and Humanities at Reed College. She teaches courses on Chinese language, literature, and culture. Aside from her book on twentieth century Chinese science fiction, she is also published in Asian Cinema, Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, Cultural Critique, and positions. She received the ACLS Pauline Yu Fellowship in 2020, and is currently working on a new book project tentatively titled &quot;The World Embedded in Modern Chinese Literary Imagination.&quot;

        The Great Exodusexamines one of the least understood forced migrations in modern East Asia—the human exodus from China to Taiwan following the Nationalist collapse and Chinese Communist victory in 1949. Peeling back layers of Cold War ideological constructs, the book tells a very different story from conventional historiographies the Chinese civil war, Chinese revolution, and Cold War Taiwan. Underscoring the displaced population’s trauma of living in exile and their poignant “homecomings” four decades later, Yang presents a multiple-event trajectory of repeated traumatization with the recurring search for home, belonging, and identity. By portraying the Chinese civil war exiles in Taiwan both as traumatized subjects of displacement and overbearing colonizers to the local peoples, this thought-provoking work challenges the established notions of trauma, memory production, diaspora, and reconciliation. It speaks to the importance of subject position, boundary-crossing empathic unsettlements, and ethical responsibility of researching, narrating, and representing historical trauma.

        With the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party faced a major dilemma: How to obtain useful information, when public debates are massively restricted and loyalty counts for more than competence? To deal with the problem of information distortion, the CCP developed a two-pronged approach: Besides public news items that catered towards mobilizational aspects, it established distinct systems of feedback loops, which were strictly tasked to separate facts from opinion in order to provide the party leadership with an objective account of domestic and international events. Over time, a distinct system for controlled circulation of intelligence, an “information order”, took shape, which remained in place until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution. Despite major disruptions, the system’s basic structures were kept alive even throughout these tumultuous years and continue to impact the CCP’s information politics until the present.

This event is the first of four parts for WEAI's Asia in Action workshop series,&quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC.&quot;

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

This talk examines citizen scoring in and public support for China’s Social Credit System (SCS). Dr. Fan analyzed the mechanism of credit scoring embedded in the SCS and show two facets of the SCS: a normative apparatus fostering “good” citizens and a regulative apparatus normalizing “deviant” behaviors. He also used a survey experiment to test how types of monitored behaviors and different information exposure explain public support for the SCS. The findings suggest that citizens are more likely to support monitoring financial behaviors. More importantly, exposure to Western media increases public support for monitoring non-financial behaviors in the SCS. Fan Liang (PhD, University of Michigan) is an Assistant Professor of Media at Duke Kunshan University. His research examines how new communication technologies construct social and political changes, and how social and political powers shape and regulate the design and operation of such technologies.

        People tend to think of decolonization in Asia as being a phenomenon of the Cold War Era, where European colonizers, having survived humiliating blows of Japanese occupation of their Asian colonies during the Second World War, reluctantly but unavoidably relinquished their suzerainty and allowed numerous new nation-states to emerge in the Asia-Pacific through the first three decades of the postwar period.

In reality, the South China Sea and its surrounding political entities have always been a realm of influence of a superpower external to the region; the British Empire during the Colonial Era and the US through much of the latter half of the 20thcentury. No sooner US influence started to recede with the conclusion of the Cold War, than South China Sea starts to experience the hegemonic encroachment of rising China. Taiwan feels the heat of increasing PRC pressure upon her precarious independent status in the global arena, while Hong Kong’s freedom once guaranteed by the Basic Law and the ‘1 country 2 systems’ principle has been continuously and methodically dismantled from the earliest years of Xi Jinping’s presidency. The democratizing trend of Southeast Asia has suffered similar setbacks, with Thailand and Myanmar reverting back to military rule and returning to draconian measures to suppress pro-democracy protesters.

The online pro-democracy network known as the ‘Milk Tea Alliance,’ which emerged in April 2020, among netizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, is the first online movement to vocalize what has been a long standing yet unspeakable suspicion among the younger generation of this region—that the Chinese Communist Government is a mutual obstacle for democratization of the Asia-Pacific. For the first time in history, the fight for Taiwan independence, Hong Kong’s freedom, and Thailand and Myanmar’s democratization becomes one and the same, united by the superpower threat against democracy and human rights in the form of PRC influence across the region. The ‘Milk Tea Alliance’ quest for freedom is the last of the unfinished business from the colonial era. It is the long overdue last wave of decolonization in Asia.

        Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia has increased dramatically since 2013 when the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was announced. The dominant investments have been in infrastructure development, power plant construction and mineral extraction and processing. In a recent collaboration with the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, the Research Center for Climate Change at the University of Indonesia (RCCC-UI) conducted a spatial environmental assessment of 14 clusters of BRI projects throughout Indonesia. The research project seeks to understand the environmental and social impacts of the projects by focusing on a project’s distance from primary forest, trends of vegetation and carbon loss, emission of nitrous oxide (NOx) as a dangerous air pollutant, the presence of selected endangered species and the presence of affected Indigenous Peoples.

Join us on Wednesday, April 20, for a discussion on the spatial environmental assessment of select BRI projects in Indonesia, featuring Rebecca Ray and University of Indonesia researchers Albertus Hadi Pramono, Masita Dwi Mandini Manessa, Mochamad Indrawan and Dwi Amalia Sari.

        This lecture explores the life of an elite woman, raised in Beijing and educated at a missionary school during the May Fourth era. Daughter of a Beiyang reformer, wife of a Nationalist official educated at MIT, mother of an underground Communist revolutionary, she herself left no direct trace in the public record. She emerges primarily in interviews with her son, and in an unfinished and unpublished historical novel by her daughter. Filial love, household management, sexual propriety, wifely duty, maternal loyalty, domestic cosmopolitanism, and shrewd political judgment mingle in her story, raising questions about where revolution lies and how we should track its less visible effects. Her life illuminates the gendered effects of China’s long revolution, the central importance of women as symbols of the nation, and the limits of what we can know about the past.

This event is the second in a four-part series for WEAI's Asia in Action workshop series, &quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC.&quot;

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

        China has become deeply integrated in the world economy, yet gradual marketization has facilitated the country’s rise without a wholesale assimilation to global neoliberalism. In her new book, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy: The Market Reform Debate,” Isabella Weber uncovers the fierce contest for economic reforms that shaped China’s path. In the first post-Mao decade, reformers were sharply divided: should China destroy the core of the socialist system through shock therapy, or should it use the institutions of the planned economy as market creators? With hindsight, the historical record proves the high stakes behind the question: China embarked on an economic expansion commonly described as unprecedented in scope and pace, whereas Russia’s economy collapsed under shock therapy.

Based on extensive research, including interviews with key Chinese and international participants and World Bank officials as well as insights gleaned from unpublished documents, “How China Escaped Shock Therapy” charts the debate that ultimately enabled China to follow a path to gradual reindustrialization. Beyond shedding light on the crossroads of the 1980s, it reveals the intellectual foundations of state-market relations in reform-era China through a longue durée lens. Overall, the book delivers an original perspective on China’s economic model and its continuing contestations from within and from without.

Join us on Thursday, April 21, for a discussion with Isabella Weber, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, on her new book and China’s path of economic reform. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global Economic Governance Book Talk Series.

        For our April book club we’re reading Joan Is Okay in preparation for our chat with the author, Weike Wang. --- Joan is a thirty-something ICU doctor at a busy New York City hospital. The daughter of Chinese parents who came to the United States to secure the American dream for their children, Joan is intensely devoted to her work, happily solitary, successful. She does look up sometimes and wonder where her true roots lie: at the hospital, where her white coat makes her feel needed, or with her family, who try to shape her life by their own cultural and social expectations.

        Digitization facilitates censorship in Chinese archives, but it also gives us new tools to study censorship and to renew the historian's craft. This talk explores the opportunities and challenges of studying twentieth-century Chinese history in the digital age. Drawing on archival statistics and metadata from several provincial collections, it begins by taking stock of the archival landscape in contemporary China: What has been made available (and not?). It then applies the latest digital methods to query the genre of &quot;nianpu&quot; (chronicles) in the Chinese Communist Party historiography. Using techniques such as named entity recognition and network analysis, it reveals internal connections and textual discrepancies to raise new questions about elite politics and political communication in Mao's China. The talk will end with ideas for digital study of modern Chinese history and practical suggestions for research data management in the age of information overload and official surveillance.

        Chinese food has been at the center of increasing anti-Chinese (Asian) sentiment since the advent of COVID-19. As the exceptionally high rate of Chinese takeout restaurants forced to close in 2020 indicates, the pandemic has reinforced a long-held racist view of Chinese food as unhealthy and unhygienic. This panel addresses how we can help to solve this problem by incorporating cooking and eating as a critical teaching component in Asian and Asian-American history classes. More specifically, it will ask what kinds of teaching methods we can experiment with when approaching food (arguably one of the most engaging themes) as an historical subject. It will also explore how we can encourage students to ask critical questions regarding Chinese food in terms of its consumption and production in order for them to appreciate the unlikely interplay of food and racial politics. Finally, it will address how the hands-on experience of cooking, which includes grocery shopping and recipe research as well as eating and sharing, can serve as a powerful teaching tool for promoting such values as diversity, inclusion, and respect in a pandemic era. Two speakers will present on their experience of teaching on this theme, which will be followed by a discussion with the audience.

This event will take place as part of WEAI’s ongoing series, “Asia in Action: Knowledge and Inclusion in a Time of Fear and Ignorance.”

        Policemen served a pivotal role in the politics of the Mao era, yet we know little about these important historical actors. Wang's paper draws upon rich archival records of police work reports to county authorities in western China from 1949 and 1963 to examine everyday practices of policing. In particular, Wang looks at the reported operation of a county police department in dealing with population movement and household registrations, which served as foundations for executing policies related to social order, political prosecution, and economic redistribution. Wang's paper analyzes these police reports with a focus on the language used, the venue and manner in which investigations were conducted, and explanations for conclusions reached. In doing so, this research sheds light on the close connections between investigative methods, the making of bureaucrats, and narrative construction as a practice of policing.

Noting that China is now the world’s largest bilateral creditor of overseas development finance, Blake Alexander Simmons, Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources at Colorado State University, will present a new study investigating the extent to which coastal development projects financed by Chinese development finance institutions present both direct and indirect risks to marine habitats, threatened species, marine protected areas and coastal Indigenous communities. Simmons will discuss where risks are greatest and how this knowledge can be used to create an agenda for “blue-ing” China’s overseas development finance portfolio.

Join us on Wednesday, May 18, for a discussion on mapping the risks of China’s global coastal development to marine socio-ecological systems. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
