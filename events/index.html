        Nirupama Rao’s book ‘The Fractured Himalaya: India Tibet China 1949 to 1962’ (Penguin Random House India, 2021) is a history of the diplomacy between India and China during a crucial period of their early nationhood.This year, 2022, we mark sixty years after the momentous events of 1962 that culminated in the brief, but bitter, conflict between India and China, fought in the high Himalaya, across terrain that is the most forbidding in the world. Public memory of the war is hazy and often , incomplete, shot through with numerous stereotypes and insufficient ‘capture’ of what happened in that eventful year. A new generation of Indians, particularly millennials, have had no exposure to what happened in 1962. Given the current state of India’s relations with China, and all the attendant complications in that relationship, telling the story of the years between 1949 and 1962 in India-China ties is of relevance to the understanding of the disputes between these two nations. A more in-depth understanding of the Tibet factor in the complex relationship is also relevant to the study of diplomacy between India and China. Drawing from her deeply researched book which delves into primary archival resources, Ambassador Rao will discuss the complex nature of the history she presents.

This talk explores the opportunities and challenges of studying twentieth-century Chinese history in the digital age. Drawing on archival statistics and metadata from several provincial collections, it begins by taking stock of the archival landscape in contemporary China: What has been made available (and not?). It then applies the latest digital methods to query the genre of &quot;nianpu&quot; (chronicles) in the Chinese Communist Party historiography. Using techniques such as named entity recognition and network analysis, it reveals internal connections and textual discrepancies to raise new questions about elite politics and political communication in Mao's China. The talk will end with ideas for digital study of modern Chinese history and practical suggestions for research data management in the age of information overload and official surveillance.

This event is the third in a four-part Asia in Action workshop series,&quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC&quot; at WEAI.

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

The next and last event is:

Wed. May 4 / 12:00 – 1:30pm

        The World Trade Organization (WTO) faces an existential crisis because it has failed to keep pace with the needs of a changing world. So argues James Bacchus, a founding member and former chairman of the Appellate Body of the WTO. Professor Bacchus sets out his analysis in a new book, Trade Links: New Rules for a New World, and will share it in our webinar. He argues that the devastating global economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically illustrated the WTO’s weaknesses and the need to update its rules to confront future pandemics and climate change and achieve sustainable development.

        The Center for Chinese Studies introduces a new book by Professor Franklin Perkins along with a Faculty Dialogue. For more than two thousand years, the writings of the Confucian philosopher Mengzi have been a source of guidance and inspiration for those set on doing something to improve the state of the world. Doing What You Really Want: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mengzi presents a coherent, systematic, and accessible explanation of Mengzi's philosophy. The book covers everything from the place of human beings in nature to human psychology and philosophy of emotions, to the various ways in which we can deliberately change and cultivate ourselves. Mengzi was concerned not just with theory but also effective action. Perkins thus includes a collection of practical advice and a Confucian analysis of politics-oriented toward how individuals can make a difference in the world. This event is co-sponsored by the UHM Department of Philosophy.

Franklin Perkins is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa and is the editor of the journal Philosophy East and West. Before coming to UH, he taught at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) and at DePaul University (Chicago), where he was Director of the Chinese Studies Program; Jim Behuniak is a Professor of Philosophy at Colby College. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Hawai`i in 2002; George Tsai is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawaii. His interests are primarily in moral and political philosophy, and, more recently, early Chinese philosophy.

        MASS TIMBER: ENGINEERED WOOD AND MATERIAL MODERNITY IN THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

        How did materials shape everyday technology in the People’s Republic of China? And what might a material history of socialist China look like? Steel and cotton were among the most famous materials, widely discussed, heavily politicized, and prominent in everyday life between the 1950s and 1980s. Yet there were several other notable materials such as plastics, synthetic fibres, aluminium, concrete, glass, or engineered woods. While these often make an appearance in historiography, they are more commonly extras rather than protagonists. Taking the example of engineered woods, this presentation explores how plywood, particleboard, and fibreboard were researched, developed, made, used, and debated as part of making a socialist everyday through technologies of all kind. From the Great Leap Forward campaign to manufacture fibreboard in small local factories as part of an attempt to supply communities with more objects of use, to the rapid rise of particle- and fibreboard as the backbones of light industrial modernization during “reform and opening”, the stories of engineered wood reveal the everyday material dimensions of mass mobilization, industrialisation, and socialist governance over time.

        Over the past 21 years, Chinese policy and commercial banks, government entities, companies and other financiers have financed billions of dollars of infrastructure, energy and development projects throughout Africa. Since 2016, financing has steadily declined, dropping from a peak of $28.4 billion to $8.3 billion in 2019.

The COVID-19 pandemic, the most serious global health crisis of the past century, has severely impacted development and commercial finance budgets around the world, including China’s. For many African countries in particular, the pandemic has also had severe social and economic impacts. Already fragile welfare systems have been threatened or overwhelmed and African intraregional and international trade, investment flows and access to financing has also been adversely affected. The full impact is still unfolding.

Amid these economic impacts, how has the pandemic impacted Chinese lending to Africa? What trends have emerged and which have endured? How have Chinese financiers adapted to changing economic and political conditions in Africa as they learn from experiences with borrowers in debt distress and debt restructuring negotiations? And what factors might shape Chinese lending to Africa in the post-pandemic era?

        Ba Jin (1904-2005), who called himself “the son of the May 4th movement,” is a giant of 20th-century Chinese literature whose writing inspired a generationof youth to join the communist movement. Written in his later years,Random Thoughtsis one of the earliest and most influential memoirs of China’s Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. His memoir testified to the double sides of the remarkable “confession” promoted by the party-state during this God-making movement. This talk examines the meaning of voice in this text from the perspective of the phenomenon of voice in Chinese literary culture in the 20th century.

By consideringRandom Thoughtsas testimonial literature,this talk presents Ba Jin’s strategy and ethics of witnessing the silent moral “grey zone” under totalitarianism by recovering his own voice.It explores what “telling the truth” – the keywords inRandom Thoughts– means and the relationship between this truth-telling and his personal beliefs and his salvation in hard times that “has no god.”

        For our April book club we’re reading Joan Is Okay in preparation for our chat with the author, Weike Wang.

--

Joan is a thirty-something ICU doctor at a busy New York City hospital. The daughter of Chinese parents who came to the United States to secure the American dream for their children, Joan is intensely devoted to her work, happily solitary, successful. She does look up sometimes and wonder where her true roots lie: at the hospital, where her white coat makes her feel needed, or with her family, who try to shape her life by their own cultural and social expectations.

Once Joan and her brother, Fang, were established in their careers, her parents moved back to China, hoping to spend the rest of their lives in their homeland. But when Joan’s father suddenly dies and her mother returns to America to reconnect with her children, a series of events sends Joan spiraling out of her comfort zone just as her hospital, her city, and the world are forced to reckon with a health crisis more devastating than anyone could have imagined.

        Chinese food has been at the center of increasing anti-Chinese (Asian) sentiment since the advent of COVID-19. As the exceptionally high rate of Chinese takeout restaurants forced to close in 2020 indicates, the pandemic has reinforced a long-held racist view of Chinese food as unhealthy and unhygienic. This panel addresses how we can help to solve this problem by incorporating cooking and eating as a critical teaching component in Asian and Asian-American history classes. More specifically, it will ask what kinds of teaching methods we can experiment with when approaching food (arguably one of the most engaging themes) as an historical subject. It will also explore how we can encourage students to ask critical questions regarding Chinese food in terms of its consumption and production in order for them to appreciate the unlikely interplay of food and racial politics. Finally, it will address how the hands-on experience of cooking, which includes grocery shopping and recipe research as well as eating and sharing, can serve as a powerful teaching tool for promoting such values as diversity, inclusion, and respect in a pandemic era. Two speakers will present on their experience of teaching on this theme, which will be followed by a discussion with the audience.

This event will take place as part of WEAI’s ongoing series, “Asia in Action: Knowledge and Inclusion in a Time of Fear and Ignorance.”

        In 2020, 93 percent of the energy consumed in Taiwan came from imported fossil fuels: oil, coal, and liquid natural gas. Taiwan’s government is also phasing out nuclear power, with the last nucleargeneration unit scheduled to be shut down in 2025. This overwhelming reliance on imports is at odds with Taiwan’s pledges to reduce its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It also presents a serious security vulnerability: a prolonged disruption of energy supplies could quickly bring Taiwan’s economy to a halt, including its strategically important semiconductor industry.

In this event, three experts on Taiwan’s energy policies will discuss Taiwan’s changing energy mix, its ambitious plans for developing renewable energy sources and lessening dependence on imports, and how Taiwan’s exclusion from important international energy bodies such as the International Energy Agency adds to its energy security challenges.

        This talk examines the Hong Kong-China maritime border since 1949. It focuses on the oyster producing communities in the tidelands of the Pearl River Estuary, showing how oystermen — some of them also refugees — faced security threats exacerbated by the Cultural Revolution while they also leveraged the borderland’s opportunities. The oyster industries are a case study in two forms of agricultural production: traditional land and labor relations on the Hong Kong coast, and collective agriculture in China’s socialist period, followed by decollectivization in the reform era. By the end of the Mao years in 1976, China’s oyster industry well exceeded that of Hong Kong’s, but both systems were vulnerable to industrial pollution. In the reform era and after, China’s oystermen built upon persistent networks to navigate their position between Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and the Pearl River Delta. The prosperity of the China oysterman, rather than the Hong Kong refugee, illustrates the inversion of the border’s valence from a postcolonial past to a postsocialist future.

        5 May 2022 marks the second anniversary of the current crisis in Eastern Ladakh, the deadliest such since 1962 and follows a series of such crises since 2013. On 5 May 2020, the first clash occurred resulting in injuries to several soldiers on both sides. This was followed by another major clash on the night of 15-16 June 2020 resulting in 20 Indian and four PLA soldiers killed in action. While the Chinese views over the current situation are ambiguous, the Indian side believes that the crisis was due to a deliberate action by the Chinese side. Despite several rounds of talks at the national, diplomatic and military levels over the past two years, the current crisis shows no sign of resolution. Existing Confidence Building Mechanisms have neither been able to prevent nor aid in resolving the current crisis. The panel discussion looks at the underlying causes for the crisis, developments over the past two years, the Chinese perspective and way ahead.

        Policemen served a pivotal role in the politics of the Mao era, yet we know little about these important historical actors. Wang's paper draws upon rich archival records of police work reports to county authorities in western China from 1949 and 1963 to examine everyday practices of policing. In particular, Wang looks at the reported operation of a county police department in dealing with population movement and household registrations, which served as foundations for executing policies related to social order, political prosecution, and economic redistribution. Wang's paper analyzes these police reports with a focus on the language used, the venue and manner in which investigations were conducted, and explanations for conclusions reached. In doing so, this research sheds light on the close connections between investigative methods, the making of bureaucrats, and narrative construction as a practice of policing.

This event is the last in a four-part Asia in Action workshop series,&quot;Remapping the Archives: New Histories of the PRC&quot; at WEAI.

Series description:

In the present moment, intensifying historical censorship in China–compounded by the lasting impacts of the pandemic–has severed access to the archive as we once knew it. The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.

        The expansion of home-grown social media platforms in the past decade has provided a (relatively) safe haven for LGBTQ+ people in China to connect online. Additionally, prior to 2016, a growing number of LGBTQ+ groups and organisations had established themselves in the country, building physical spaces of connection and belonging. In recent years, negative effects were brought on by (1) closures of LQBTQ+ social media accounts, (2) laws and regulations that chipped away at organisational capacity, and (3) the Covid-19 pandemic—a convenient excuse to cancel in-person LGBTQ+ activities. Considering the increasing restrictions in the digital and institutional spaces, we posit the question of how LGBTQ+ activists and communities in China have responded to the cocktail of institutional and digital surveillance. The findings of this exploratory research suggest that the LGBTQ+ communities have been negatively affected by institutional marginalisation, digital censorship, as well as harsh police monitoring and harassment.

This research is based on a working paper, co-authored by Ausma Bernot and Professor Sara E. Davies.

About the Speaker

Ausma Bernot is a PhD Candidate at the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Griffith University. She has six years of work experience with forensic science and research organisations across the globe, in particular China, where she had the chance to gain insights on how technologies are governed at provincial and national levels. Her current research focuses on the effects that the merging of infotech and biotech triggers in the fields of governance, surveillance, policing, and public safety. Ausma’s doctoral research explores the dynamic interaction between surveillance technologies and social context and questions totalisation of surveillance in China.

        The US is on the backfoot in the South Pacific. Distracted by other global challenges, it has for a long time outsourced its regional policymaking to Australia and New Zealand. But the South Pacific is essential to US security. If a hostile power controls a base in the region, it could block shipping traffic from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean to the Coral Sea, and beyond. It’s time for the US to step up and make a significant commitment to the Pacific region. This talk surveys China’s interests and activities in the South Pacific and considers policy options for the US going forward.

        Rapid coastal development presents substantial risks to marine habitats, biodiversity and coastal communities dependent upon vital marine ecosystem services. Noting that China is now the world’s largest bilateral creditor of overseas development finance, Blake Alexander Simmons, Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources at Colorado State University, will present a new study investigating the extent to which coastal development projects financed by Chinese development finance institutions present both direct and indirect risks to marine habitats, threatened species, marine protected areas and coastal Indigenous communities. Simmons will discuss where risks are greatest and how this knowledge can be used to create an agenda for “blue-ing” China’s overseas development finance portfolio.

--

After a meteoric rise, China today is one of the world’s most powerful nations. Just a century ago, it was a crumbling empire with literacy reserved for the elite few, as the world underwent a massive technological transformation that threatened to leave them behind. InKingdom of Characters, Jing Tsu argues that China’s most daunting challenge was a linguistic one: the century-long fight to make the formidable Chinese language accessible to the modern world of global trade and digital technology.

Kingdom of Charactersfollows the bold innovators who reinvented the Chinese language, among them an exiled reformer who risked a death sentence to advocate for Mandarin as a national language, a Chinese-Muslim poet who laid the groundwork for Chairman Mao’s phonetic writing system, and a computer engineer who devised input codes for Chinese characters on the lid of a teacup from the floor of a jail cell. Without their advances, China might have never become the dominating force we know today.

        What constitutes being human? What are the boundaries or fuzzy edges of humanity? What can we learn from exploring the margins of humanity? These questions lie at the heart of this symposium, which will bring together twelve scholars across a variety of fields to consider how concepts analogous to our contemporary idea of “the human” were defined and debated in Medieval China.

We hope that the papers assembled for the symposium will open new, interdisciplinary vistas on the ways in which ethnocultural others, sociological underclasses, striking and different individuals, animals and gods, and ex- and future-humans were conceptualized and written about in the medieval period, and on the ways in which these marginal beings expressed and challenged the self-understandings of the authors of the materials that survive to us.

The symposium will be held via Zoom from 10am to 1pm, EST, on June 1st through June 3rd, 2022. Registration is free andopen to the public.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
