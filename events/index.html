        Abstract

Until the discovery in 1975 of legal documents in tomb #11, Shuihudi, Hubei, belonging to a Qin scribe who died in about 217 BCE, virtually nothing was known of actual Qin legal practice or how it was transformed in the early Han dynasty. Scholars had to rely on the descriptions presented in transmitted historical texts such as the Shi ji (Historical Records) composed by Sima Qian (died ca. 86 BCE), and other works. The legal reality of the Qin and early Han was vague in the extreme. This paper will focus on the types of legislation, the ways in which legislation was created, how it was applied in practice, and some fundamental legal concepts, based on recently excavated documents including the Qin materials excavated at Shuihudi and those from the archives of the Qin County of Qianling, found in Well no. 1, Liye, Hunan Province. Materials retrieved from other scientifically excavated tombs and the looted Qin documents held by the Yuelu Academy, Hunan University will also be reviewed. How Qin law was transformed by the Han government will be analyzed through a discussion of the legal documents found in Tomb 247, Zhangjiashan, Hubei, dating to approximately 186 BCE, from the legal documents published this spring (2023) retrieved from Tomb no. 336 in the same cemetery, dating to Han Wendi’s reign, and other legal materials of comparable date.

        Abstract

This presentation is an account of a small pilot project that explored patterns of women writers’ social networks in three significant chronological periods in late imperial and modern China—the High Qing (1700-1839), Late Qing (1840-1910), and Republican era (1911-1949) by using data from the Ming Qing Women’s Writings digital archive and database (MQWW https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/mingqing/). The project examined two categories of data provided by paratexts and texts in 332 poetry collections by women over the three periods to identify the significance of two types of Social Networks (A and B) connected to women’s writing and the publication of their collections : Type A broadly concerned the degree to which women’s participation as “actors and agents” who contributed paratexts to the “packaging” of other women’s poetry collections in these periods, and Type B explored the constitution of a woman poet’s own social and cultural community by means of poetic exchange.Through visualization of these data, the project aimed to show how women writers and their publications, by negotiating different genres of poetry and prose, could build social connections and linkages that crossed or affirmed spatial, gender, and ethnic boundaries in late imperial and early 20th-century China and at the same time to illustrate the potential of using digital tools and methods to enhance humanistic research.

Guotong Li (Professor, Department of History, California State University Long Beach)

Dr. Li’s current research interests focus on gender and family in maritime Asia during the encounters between the Muslim diaspora and Chinese merchants before European hegemony. She has published two monographs, entitledMigrating Fujianese: Ethnic, Family, and Gender Identities in an Early Modern Maritime World(Brill, 2016) andIn Quest of Immortality: Women’s Education in Late Imperial China, 1368-1911(Guangxi Normal University Press, 2014) respectively. She is completing her new book project on a Chinese Muslim community in late imperial Quanzhou, the world’s largest seaport under the Mongol empire. This project was sponsored by a Luce/ACLS fellowship (2015-2016), aiming to bring a more global perspective on local histories and to enrich global maritime history with the human agency of gender and ethnicity.



Yulian Wu (Associate Professor, Department of History, Michigan State University)

Professor Wu's research examines the relationship between ethnic policies, material culture, and gender relations in the High Qing period (1680-1820). Her work asks how the Manchu court, the minority rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), implemented ethnic policies by constructing a material world and how men and women’s lives were influenced and transformed by the changing material culture.

        Professor Huang's on-going project is tentatively titled &quot;Husbands in Mourning: Bereavement, Memory and Gender in Late Imperial China.&quot; It concentrates on different kinds of elegiac writings by male literati on their deceased spouses in Ming-Qing China (approximately 16th-19th centuries), examining the questions of how womanhood was constructed and defined by men in a polygamous society and how such male reflections on womanhood in turn helped define these grieving authors’ own manhood in relation to their spouses as well as their male peers.

        In April 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the launch of a new Global Security Initiative. Nearly a year later, in March 2023, the Chinese government issued a Concept Paper outlining the 6 principles. 20 cooperation areas, and 5 platforms that will enable the operationalisation of GSI. In this session, Manoj Kewalramani, Chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution, will be discussing his research on the evolution of GSI and its implications for Indian interests.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	Relationships with bureaucracies, commercial counterparts and civil society in host countries
	
	Communist party influence on organisational structure, style of operating and incentive and penalties for employees.
	
	How Chinese companies manage the complexities of operating in international environments including language, host country markets, unfamiliar political systems, and cultural milieus as well as with competition from other commercial entities.
	
	Case studies of particular Chinese companies operating abroad, or conversely, a range of Chinese companies operating in a particular host country.


The publishing outcomes of this conference will include a special issue proposal toThe China Journal.

If you are interested in participating, please send a 250 word abstract, a brief CV and your institutional affiliation to the conference organiser, Dr Greg Raymondgreg.raymond@anu.edu.auby30 March 2023. A limited number of travel bursaries may be available – please enquire if needed
