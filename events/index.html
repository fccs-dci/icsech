        WELFARE BOUNDARY FOR MIGRANT FAMILIES IN CHINA: WHAT, WHERE, AND HOW?

With the recent reform of household registration system (hukou) in China, equalizing welfare benefits and public services among all Chinese citizens regardless of their hukou status has been the goal and direction of social welfare provision. However, migrants in the urban cities are still living on the periphery and faced with various barriers to access welfare benefits and services. This study argues that, despite the reform of the hukou registration, the conflict between the universal rights of all citizens in a society and the limited resources for welfare provision in a particular place will continue to exist. Consequently, the compromise between the rights and resources would create a threshold that defines a set of eligibility criteria to decide who are included/excluded from enjoying the benefits. It proposes a new conceptual construct, welfare boundary, to delineate such a compromised threshold. Taking into account migrants’ subjective experiences of welfare access, it further identifies two forms of welfare boundary: institutional (derived from policies) and perceptional (derived from migrants’ own experiences). Drawing upon qualitative data collected in southern China where a great many migrants are concentrated, this study elaborates on the two forms of welfare boundary through understanding from the migrants’ own perspectives that how welfare boundary is defined, where welfare boundary exists, how it is manifested, perceived and experienced by migrants and their families, and how they cope and negotiate with the welfare boundaries. This research contributes to our understanding of China’s current mobility regime characterized by differential inclusion in the context of ongoing reform and development.

        THE KING’S ROAD: DIPLOMACY AND THE REMAKING OF THE SILK ROAD
      </h3></div><div><p class="text-gray-800 text-sm">
        XIN WEN IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES AND HISTORY AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. HE IS A HISTORIAN OF MEDIEVAL CHINA, CENTRAL ASIA, AND EURASIA. HIS FIRST BOOK IS THE KING’S ROAD: DIPLOMACY AND THE REMAKING OF THE SILK ROAD (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2022). HE IS NOW WORKING ON A SECOND BOOK THAT CHARTS THE URBAN HISTORY OF CHANG’AN AFTER THE FALL OF THE TANG DYNASTY.

        The King’s Road offers a new interpretation of the history of the Silk Road, emphasizing its importance as a diplomatic route, rather than a commercial one. Tracing the arduous journeys of diplomatic envoys, Xin Wen presents a rich social history of long-distance travel that played out in deserts, post stations, palaces, and polo fields. The book tells the story of the everyday lives of diplomatic travelers on the Silk Road—what they ate and drank, the gifts they carried, and the animals that accompanied them—and how they navigated a complex web of geographic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. It also describes the risks and dangers envoys faced along the way—from financial catastrophe to robbery and murder. Using documents unearthed from the famous Dunhuang “library cave” in Western China, The King’s Road paints a detailed picture of the intricate network of trans-Eurasian transportation and communication routes that was established between 850 and 1000 CE.

By exploring the motivations of the kings who dispatched envoys along the Silk Road and describing the transformative social and economic effects of their journeys, the book reveals the inner workings of an interstate network distinct from the Sino-centric “tributary” system. In shifting the narrative of the Silk Road from the transport of commodities to the exchange of diplomatic gifts and personnel, The King’s Road puts the history of Eastern Eurasia in a new light.

        China Engineers, Ltd. (信昌機器工程公司) was a hybrid company founded in 1928 by the Eurasian entrepreneur William Charles Gomersall (1895 – 1960). It was registered according to the Hong Kong ordinances, but its main economic activity took place in its branch office in Shanghai. Besides being major shareholder, Gomersall was elected director for life, while the company mixed Chinese and British partners. Between 1928 and 1936, China Engineers became an important provider of textile machinery to Chinese industrialists, who thrived in Shanghai and the surrounding cities. However, when the war against Japan clashed in July 1937, the industrial machinery trade reached a standstill and China Engineers had to look for alternative activities to survive. This is a part of a book project about the business history of China Engineers, from 1928 to 1972. It will deal with the wartime period and profit from the archives found in Shanghai and Hong Kong as well as the private diary of William Charles Gomersall. The long war strengthened the ties between the company and the Chinese entrepreneurs from one side, and the British government from the other, facilitating transfers of capital and machinery between Shanghai and Hong Kong, especially in the postwar period.

        Prof Christopher Rea will join us in-person to discuss the intersection of Chinese cinema &amp;amp; digital humanities. Book you free ticket now!

How can we use digital platforms—including social media—to enhance research and learning on modern China? How can we make the “obscure” (to non-specialists) discoverable? What are the expected and unexpected results of making an audiovisual archive public, as measured by views, comments, likes, or GoogleAnalytics data? And what happens when your book project morphs into a multi-platform digital extravaganza?

This presentation will share discoveries from the first few years of the Chinese Film Classics Project (chinesefilmclassics.org), an ongoing international effort to make early Chinese cinema history more accessible to the English-speaking world. Christopher Rea will speak about his experiences building an online course while writing his book Chinese Film Classics, 1922-1949 (2021), and how he worked with collaborators to create a free digital archive of early Chinese films with English translations. He will illustrate the talk with examples of “playlist pedagogy,” including curatorial techniques that highlight significant features of Chinese films, from songs to scenes to special effects. The presentation will also showcase sights and scenes from Chinese films of the “pre-Code,” WWII, and Civil War eras.

        Conflicts over specific rules lie at the heart of the narrative of China's island disputes with its neighbors in the East and South China Seas. But the main contest concerns the strategic waters associated with those islands. To consolidate control over this vital maritime space, China's leadershave begun to enforce &quot;China's Law of the Sea&quot; by building domestic legal institutions, bureaucratic organizations, and a naval and maritime law enforcement apparatus that overmatches regionalchallengers and imposes costs on navalpowers around the globe. Dr. Kardon and Dr. Dutton will explore questions such as, will states choose to acquiesce to China's preferences? Will there be conflict? Or will states find peaceful ways to overcome China's challenge to the international maritime order?Use discount code: Y23Kardon for 30% off Dr. Kardon’s new book, China’s Law of the Sea: The New Rules of Maritime Order (Yale University Press, 2023).

        The area studies model was a particular US invention during the Cold War, and ever since Bruce Cumming’s seminal essay &quot;Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War&quot; [1997], there have been academic debates in the US on the “uses and abuses” of this model and its implication for cross-cultural knowledge production. As early as 2017, a document issued by the Chinese Ministry of Education had inaugurated a new phase for the discipline, and by 2018, more than 400 research centers had been established at top Chinese universities dedicated to various regions of strategic importance, including Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, etc. Bringing together prominent area studies scholars from China and the US, this interdisciplinary faculty roundtable aims to explore the future promise as well as lessons of the area studies model in China and the US.

        In May 1877, the British government of the Straits Settlements set up the Chinese Protectorate. Five months later, the Qing government established a Chinese consulate in Singapore. What is the literary-historical impact of the rivalry between the Straits Settlements government and the Qing government on matters regarding migrant Chinese labor and customs? Using archival sources such as mining agreements and colonial textbooks, I consider this, as well as the Chinese question in late nineteenth-century Southeast Asia through the wider lens of extractive capitalism and land tenure across Malaya, Sarawak, and Patani.

With a career spanning 47 years at the Library of Congress, Susan Meinheit has had a pioneering role in the development, management, and conservation of the Library of Congress' vast Tibetan collection, one of the largest in the world. From her first LC position as a library clerk, it was through her area and language expertise -- combined with sheer determination -- that she essentially carved out her role as steward and champion of LC's long-neglected early TIbetan holdings which were based on the collections of three major scholars of Tibet and southwest China and acquired by LC in the early 1900s. Meinheit will talk about the early history of the collection; the growth of the collection through the PL-480 Books program with India, and achievements in bringing wider visibility of the Tibetan holdings through major cataloging and digitization initiatives.

        As China opened up its economy over the past four decades, conventional wisdom held that the country’s growing embrace of free markets would lead to a more liberal society. Instead, China’s unprecedented economic growth has positioned state capitalism as a durable foil to the orthodoxy of free markets, to the confusion of many in the West. Xi Jinping was recently appointed to a third five-year term as China’s supreme leader, and has increasingly doubled down on state control of the economy and many have commented on his renewed embrace of Maoist principles. What does this mean for the future of the Chinese economy and relations with the West? What are the implications of China returning to some of the ideological principles spearheaded by Mao Zedong? And how much of China’s decades of economic success can be credited to Mao and Maoism?

Christopher Marquis will discuss his new book, Mao and Markets (Yale University Press, 2023) which examines these questions and charts how Mao’s ideological principles, mass campaigns, and socialist institutions have enduringly influenced Chinese entrepreneurs, listed companies and provincial and city politicians.

        With China’s tacit support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been much talk in global media about a new China-Russia alliance against the West. This has been supported by evidence of military cooperation, such as joint naval drills in the East China Sea in December 2022, as well as Xi Jinping’s advocacy of an authoritarian “Beijing model” as an ideological and political alternative to the “Washington consensus”. But China and Russia have a long history of conflict as well, from imperial Russian aggressions against Qing China, to the Sino-Soviet split during the Cold War.

So what are the prospects for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century? How do mainland Chinese view Russia? We are joined by four scholars currently working on different aspects of China-Russia relations:


	Ed Pulford, Lecturer in Chinese Studies, Manchester (Chinese views of Putin; Sino-Russian friendship);
	Elena Barabantseva, Senior Lecturer in Politics, Manchester (male Chinese views of Russian and Ukrainian women);
	Tao Wang, Hallsworth Research Fellow, Manchester (what surveys reveal about Chinese attitudes towards the Russian invasion of Ukraine);
	Yi Wang, Assistant professor in politics, U. Birmingham (recent Chinese social media debates over Russia).

        In this talk, India China Institute’s Postdoctoral Fellow Sarandha Jain will discuss her PhD dissertation, which studies the oil-mediated relationship between the Indian state and citizens. Focusing on both oil production and consumption, presenting ethnography of oil refineries, research institutes, state offices, a peri-urban working-class-neighborhood near Delhi, and ‘black markets’, her talk examines oil as an infrastructure for the state and for society. She argues that the Indian state distributes itself into citizens’ lives via petroleum products, which obtain their sociopolitical agencies while being produced in certain ways, and play out those agencies while being consumed in certain ways. Her ethnography of refineries details out the microprocesses of oil refining and the complex relationship that human and nonhuman actors share. It elaborates on how politics get programmed into petroleum products, designed to discipline consumer-citizens into particular lifestyles, and how varying actors encumber this. Research on oil consumption with ‘black-marketeers’ and ordinary consumers of petroleum products, probes “distorted discipline”, where governmental plans get mangled by the informal practices of state actors as well as citizens. How does the politics programmed into petroleum products in refineries actually play out once other actors intervene, and snatch control over oil away from the state? Investigating this tussle between legalized and illegalized groups, she describes how it structures citizens’ lives, and the constellations of power and forms of sociality it gives rise to. This talk highlights the constant churning between the state and citizens through ever-evolving devices of government, as well as through escape from them. Specific modes of subjectification, engineered through flows of oil, lie at the heart of this churning, over which state-citizen formations are negotiated.

        A book launch dialogue between author &amp;amp; researcher Gordon Barrett and Oxford Prof Jennifer Altehenger on China's Cold War Science Diplomacy.

China’s rise as a global superpower in science, technology, and medicine has played a formative role in shaping the trajectory of international scientific cooperation and exchange in recent decades. Its increasing international prominence and influence has sparked ever-greater interest in the relationship between science and the country’s foreign relations with a wide range of state and non-state actors. In doing so, the focus has invariably tended to fall on the most conspicuous phases in China’s international scientific engagement, particularly from the period of ‘reform and opening up’ under Deng Xiaoping onward. But did China’s international influence in science really only start in the 1970s?

Examining the history of China’s international scientific outreach from the 1940s through the 1970s, Dr Barrett’s new book argues that the Mao era was a formative period in China’s science diplomacy. During these early decades of the Cold War, the People’s Republic of China may have remained outside much of mainstream international science; nevertheless, Chinese scientists found alternative channels through which to communicate and interact with counterparts across the world, beyond simple East/West divides. By examining the international activities of elite Chinese scientists, the book demonstrates the significance of these activities being rooted in ‘united front work’ and deeply embedded in the Chinese Communist Party’s wider efforts to win hearts and minds overseas. Using a wide range of material from Chinese and foreign archives, China’s Cold War Science Diplomacy provides fresh insights into the evolving relationship between science and foreign relations in the People’s Republic of China.

        Chinese companies operating beyond China’s borders constitute a geopolitical force but are relatively under-researched. TheGlobal China Research Spokeof the Australian National UniversityAustralian Centre for China in the World (CIW) will hold a conference in Canberra to extend knowledge on this topic of increasing political and strategic importance.

The two-day conference 29-30 June 2023 seeks insightful perspectives on Chinese companies operating abroad ranging from state-owned enterprises to private start-ups to organised crime syndicates operating in fields as diverse as high tech, infrastructure and online gambling.

The conference will have a cross-border and cross-disciplinary focus, looking at the dynamics between Chinese companies and their host states. Academics and emerging scholars with expertise in China studies, business, and the politics and societies of host states in regions including Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, are all welcome to participate.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:


	Relationships with the Chinese party-state and the host state
	
	Chinese companies operating abroad in comparative historical perspective, including with European company-states of the colonial era
	
	Relationships between Chinese companies operating abroad and China’s foreign policy goals
	
	Internal structure and operations of Chinese companies operating abroad
	
	The origins and influences of Chinese companies operating abroad
