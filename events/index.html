        There are a number of problems with liberal democracy, especially the institution of one person one vote. Many democratic and liberal thinkers understand them and try to correct them from within. The speaker however argues that such revisions are fundamentally inadequate to address the problems. A sounder political arrangement could emerge from conceptualising a hybrid regime that contains both democratic and meritocratic elements, which is what a Confucian would propose. The speaker illustrates the basic arrangements of such a regime, and argues why it can not only deal with the extant problems but also why it is superior to contemporary democratic regimes.

        Drawing on a wealth of interviews with more than fifty key stakeholders from Australia and China, including five former Australian Prime Ministers, Fitzsimmons presents a history and analysis of Australian-Chinese relations since 1972.

Fitzsimmons systematically examines how Canberra formulates and implements Australia’s China policy, and how PMs and key influencers have made that policy over the last fifty years. Next, it analyses the style, manner and effectiveness of Australian Prime Ministers and other key foreign-policy makers in making Australian policy on China. Next, it charts how Australian policy on China has changed over different political periods. It also highlights Australian policy to China as a global case study for other countries who are closely examining and learning lessons from how one Asia-Pacific middle-power has dealt with the Chinese colossus.

        Join us to hear from Dr. Keyu Jin, whose recently published book - The New China Playbook: beyond socialism and capitalism - is already causing a stir and bringing new insights to those who would like to better understand the China of today. A Chinese economist educated both in the U.S. and China, Dr. Jin is currently an associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics and a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. She specializes in international macroeconomics and the Chinese economy.

“The biggest geopolitical change of the twenty-first century will be the end of exclusive Western political and economic dominance. The rise of China is at the core of this change and Keyu Jin is a brilliant thinker to take us through its implications from the perspectives of someone who understands both China and the West. It is this combination of insider and outsider insight that makes The New China Playbook essential reading.&quot;
—Tony Blair, former prime minister of the United Kingdom

“Keyu Jin is one of the most extraordinary young economists I have ever encountered.”
–Larry Summers, Former Secretary of the Treasury and President of Harvard

This special event is made possible though the collaborative efforts of the US Heartland China Association, Global Minnesota, and the China US Exchange Foundation.

        In the history of medicine and health, the barefoot doctor scheme in China during the Cultural Revolution was a synonym for the provision of rural health care in the Maoist era. This talk examines how socio-political, disease, and economic factors contributed to the development of the barefoot doctor program and shaped the unique path of health provision in China over the past seven decades. It analyses how the government clarified and addressed the contradiction between ideological equity and structural inequity. It discusses how epidemiologic transition both facilitated and challenged the barefoot doctor program. The talk further investigates how the changing roles and function of barefoot doctors has impacted the evolution of community medicine since the late 1960s. It discusses how the barefoot doctors echoed the themes of social medicine in developing and developed countries and left its inspirations and legacies. By revisiting the state’s role in the barefoot doctor program, this research aims to contribute to a new understanding of the global history of medicine and health in the twentieth century and beyond when socio-politics, epidemiologic transition, and medical technology shaped social determinants of health and the relationship between medicine and politics in China.

- Abstract: Long before Zhang Qian 張騫 (d. 114 BCE) made his celebrated trip through Central Asia, people were passing back and forth along the entire breadth of Eurasia. Chinese silk has been found woven into the air of a female mummy from Egypt dating to about 1000 BCE. On the other hand, there is evidence of the knowledge of—if not necessarily—the physical presence of Egyptian-style papyrus in China about the same time. Other examples of contact across Eurasia include horse-drawn chariots from no later than 1200 BCE down to the pyramids covering tombs in the mid-Warring States period and even the statues of soldiers near the tomb of Qin Shihuang (d. 210 BCE). In this talk, I will present comparisons of these types of artifacts on either end of what would become the Silk Roads.

Lecture 2: The Fates of the Last Rulers of the Warring States
2023/10/13 │ 16:00 – 17:30
It has been argued that we know little about what happened to these rulers with the exception of the famous story of Heir Dan of Yan. Yet Han-dynasty texts like the Shiji and the Han shu as well as the accounts in the Zizhi tongjian and Ming and Qing literary works reveal much about these royal clans and their descendants. This lecture will attempt to select several examples from these last rulers to show that we can postulate in more detail some of their fates.

        In 1932, a group of leftist poets in Shanghai established the China Poetry Society, aiming to produce poetry that would enlighten and mobilize the masses to be the self-conscious political subject. This talk revisits the poetic works and theories of the members of the Society, focusing in particular on the extensive discussion on the historical origin and political relevance of poetic rhythm and its relationship with labor. Tracking the transnational circulation and transformation of the new knowledge of bodily rhythm and poetic rhythm since the late 19th century, this talk shows how a new conception of poetic rhythm as a mediating and mobilizing device gave rise to a series of leftist poetic experiments that attempted to construct the collective political subject through invoking the bodily solidarity of the laboring masses.
