        This talk will introduce the China’s ‘red collectors’, collectors of ‘red relics’: objects relating to the Chinese Communist Party, People’s Liberation Army and the history of Chinese socialism. In introducing these collectors, the talk will seek to make two arguments. The first is that these collections and the motivations of those who collect them are much more varied and diverse than most of the academic literature has hitherto acknowledged. The talk will present a history of the field and through tracing the emergence of the field of collecting from the 1980s onwards, will argue that any critical potential the field may have initially embodied has been eliminated through its gradual professionalisation. In parallel with this, the self-identity of the collectors has risen, with collectors now seeing themselves as patriotic members of the cultural elite, and as transmitters of history, culture and ‘positive energy’ to the younger generation.

This study examines family property structures in relocated rural communities in the urbanizing China. Drawing on survey and interview data from Ningxia, Northwestern China, this study illustrates how relocated housing properties were divided between male and female family members. The findings suggest that both gender and family structures matter in shaping family property structures. On the one hand, men tended to receive more housing properties across different families. On the other hand, women’s access to family properties is affected by mechanisms different from that of men. Given the changes in government policies and local customs, rural families have adapted their strategies of property management but patriarchal traditions have coexisted and interacted with new demands and new tensions among family members in the era of urbanization.

Women’s Entitlement in China’s Urbanization: Family Division of Relocated Housing Properties(Monday 19 August 2024)



This presentation focuses on how Chinese female political leaders are represented in media, through the examination of the People’s Daily’s coverage of female Politburo members since 1949: Jiang Qing, Ye Qun, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yi, Liu Yandong and Sun Chunlan. Existing scholarship argues that media representation of women’s political life reflects existing gender norms of ‘public man, private women’, and largely sees the relationship between media, gender and political leadership as static.

The representation of early generations of female Chinese leaders confirms this view. This is illustrated by the cases of Jiang Qing and Ye Qun’s political roles being portrayed as mere mistakes, and the cases of Deng Yingchao’s public roles being seen as an extension of her domestic roles and extensive media attention being paid to Wu Yi’s private life. Since the last decade, however, there has been little difference between media representation of female and male politicians.

The authors argues that media representation of female politicians is a changing dynamic. In an authoritarian system, the changes can be caused by the varying needs of the dominant political party at different times. In the case of China, these are the needs of dealing with legitimacy crises, presenting a positive image to the outside world, and strengthening its centralized rule.

The Shanghai-based Grass Stage theater troupe performed versions of World Factory at various venues in China, Hong Kong, and North America from 2014-2016. World Factory, a non-narrative, experimental documentary-based production, considered China’s new working class from historical, subjective, psychic, and social perspectives. Performances were also venues for intense and heated discussion with the audience. 2016, as the character of the Xi Jinping regime became more and more clear, marked an apogee not only for the performance, but for the Chinese worker’s movement in general. This talk traces Grass Stage’s trajectory from World Factory to the present, and uses that trajectory as a diagnosis of the state of political subjectivity and the fate of social critique.

Christopher Conneryis Professor in the Literature department at the University of California Santa Cruz, where he teaches Cultural Studies, Chinese Studies, and courses in Marxist and neoliberal theory. He has also served recently as Visiting Professor in the graduate department of Cultural Studies at Shanghai University. His research has involved four areas: early imperial Chinese culture and history (Empire of the Text: Writing and Authority in Early Imperial China ;contributions to theColumbia History of Chinese Literature) ; oceanic ideology and mythos in global capitalism (articles inboundary 2,Journal of Historical Geography,PMLA,Harvard Design Magazine, et al); the global 1960s (various anthologized articles, plus special issues ofboundary 2andInter-Asia Cultural Studies); and contemporary Chinese culture, ideology, and politics (articles inMade in China,boundary 2,New Left Review, et al). Since 2010 he has been involved as writer, performer, and political consultant in the Shanghai-based, Chinese-language social and experimental theater group Grass Stage, which has performed throughout China, as well as in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Macao, and North America.

        Urban inhabitants have long had an emotional attachment to the cities they live in. This expresses itself through daily life, culture, and heritage. This talk highlights some of the ways in which urban populations in China have reflected on their emotional attachment to the city. Examples includehuaigupoetry mourning the loss of Luoyang, guidebooks that waxed lyrical on the sites of Ming Dynasty Nanjing, and emotional appeals to create socialist production cities in Maoist China.

Within this broader context of emotional attachment to place, one of the issues that inspires the most vigorous responses is heritage. Study of the protection, use, and development of heritage assets often focuses on their economic value and the local and broader politics around specific sites. However, to the people who are most attached to heritage, it is the emotional connection that is the most important. This talk explores examples from Hong Kong, such as the Star Ferry. It sets these in a global context by thinking about how emotional attachment to heritage is guiding urban policy and planning. As rapid urbanization sweeps all before it in skyscrapers of steel and glass, I ask whether prioritising an emotional approach to heritage has the potential to create cities that are more accessible, equitable, and sustainable.

        &quot;Good Wife, Wise Mother”: Assimilating Han Taiwanese Under Japanese Rule

In 1897, two years after Japan began its half-century rise as an imperial power, it inaugurated an ambitious experiment to make modern Japanese citizens out of Han Taiwanese schoolgirls in its first overseas colony, Taiwan. The goal of the segregated education was to train Taiwanese boys and men to become government clerks and teachers, and girls and women to become “good wives, wise mothers” (ryōsai kenbo). This gendered education was part of dōka, the Japanese assimilation program, as it sought to make everyone in the empire “Japanese” as equals by teaching the Japanese language and imperial ethics with gendered roles. Constructed by engaging with the cult of domesticity in the West that envisioned the home as a private space for women and the workplace as a public space for men to build strong nation-states, “good wife, wise mother” emerged in Japan in the 1890s and was introduced to Taiwan in the same decade.

Using periodicals and Japanese language textbooks, I examine the discourse and implementation of this ideal womanhood in Taiwan. This ideal of womanhood was crucial to the civilizing mission of the colonizers. Japanese colonial authority used gender to increase the supposed distance of civilizational levels between the colonizer and the colonized. By introducing gender into the discussion on dōka in Taiwan, I show that the promise of equality and inclusion from dōka became even less attainable and thus slowed assimilation to the supposedly superior Japanese civilization when colonial officials and educators characterized the colonized as feminine and depicted colonized women as the symbol of Taiwan’s “backwardness.”

Gendered assimilation became almost attainable for the Taiwanese toward the end of World War II compared to the pre-war dōka efforts. Ethnic and class divisions were blurred during wartime mobilization as the colonial government expanded the responsibilities of schoolgirls and women, thus blurring the distinction between Taiwanese and Japanese. Wartime mobilization redefined gendered assimilation in colonial Taiwan, as it shifted the training and focus of “good wives, wise mothers”, from the individual households only, to the entire empire, which meant that schoolgirls were trained to become “good wives, wise mothers” of the empire.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
