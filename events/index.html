        The 2021 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games were initially seen as a testament to resilience as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But this image was sullied by subsequent allegations of widespread bribery and price-fixing involving a director of the Organizing Committee, major sponsors, and contractors. Professor Masayuki Tamaruyaof the University of Tokyo will discuss why international sports financing so often produces corruption scandals, perennial challenges in both international and domestic sports governance, and Japan’s efforts to improve transparency and compliance in its own sports federations and university sports – with mixed results.

        Emory University's Ph.D. Candidate in History, Jiajun Zou, introduces a fresh perspective to Ming dynasty studies with his pioneering dataset of 92,000 juren profiles. In his presentation, Zou will share his journey in assembling this comprehensive dataset, utilizing a mix of CBDB resources, computational techniques, and prompt engineering via ChatGPT. He will then present statistical and macro-level evidence of a geographical bias within the examination system, underscoring how proximity to examination centers at both the provincial and national levels significantly impacted odds of success. Zou contends that the examination system displayed a clear proximity bias, favoring those closer to central hubs in terms of outlasting and exhausting their group competitors over time. The challenges faced by peripheral prefectures and regions are attributed not to a lack of talent—as some of the most distant prefectures produced the highest number of juren in China but only a handful of jinshi. Moving beyond the narratives of educational and intellectual traditions, Zou explores whether rising costs of competition, influenced by geographical and social dynamics, shifted the balance of political power in Ming China. This presentation aims to highlight the value of a macro analytical approach using a large dataset to reveal hidden trends and to encourage modern scholars to independently tackle research challenges with innovative digital techniques.

An event sponsored by China Biographical Database Project (CBDB) and Digital China Initiative (DCI), Harvard University. The event will be recorded for archival purposes. The presenter can be reached for on-demand video.

        China’s escalating coercion campaign against Taiwan is causing seismic shifts in strategic thinking across the region, perhaps nowhere more than in Japan. Although most discussions about the status and future of Taiwan focus on the China-Taiwan-US triangle, Japan arguably has as much or more at stake than the US. Japan’s first and third-largest trading partners are China and Taiwan, respectively. If hostilities broke out between the two, it would be difficult for Japan to remain on the sidelines. Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center, will explain Japan’s perspective on Taiwan, how it hopes to maintain the status quo, and how rising tensions have pushed it to dramatically revise its national security posture.

        In late-February 2024, the U.S.-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement will expire if it is not signed or extended. The first major agreement to be signed by the two governments following the normalization of ties in 1979, the STA was last renewed in 2018 (and temporarily extended in August 2023). In the time since its last renewal, S&amp;amp;T ties have been battered by a raft of decoupling measures as well as probes by the Justice Department and the National Institutes of Health into Beijing’s economic espionage and intellectual property diversion activities. On the other hand, the U.S. and China remain each other’s top scientific partners, with collaborative research between American and Chinese nationals being a standout feature among the most-cited academic papers.

As the late-February deadline approaches, can the two sides buck the trend on technology decoupling and renew or at least temporarily extend their STA? How important is it to renew the agreement? What have been its main achievements and what are the chief criticisms levied against the agreement? Where do the negotiations on renewal stand, and what are the key improvements sought? Realistically, what are the chances of a technology cooperation agreement being signed during a charged election year? Broadening the frame, what is the state of U.S.-China S&amp;amp;T exchanges, and how has China’s domestic S&amp;amp;T ecosystem evolved over the past four decades? Will the new (Party) Central Science and Technology Commission and its emphasis on self-reliance scramble the prospects for bilateral cooperation? How should the STA be improved to reflect the new maturity, and tensions, in cross-border scientific ties? To listen to these and other answers and insights on pressing U.S.-China S&amp;amp;T policy questions, tune in to the event on February 20.

Three members of the USHCA's leadership had the honor to be invited to a small &quot;old friends&quot; reception to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco on November 18, 2023, the same day that President Biden and President Xi met on the sidelines of the APEC meetings. Following that small gathering, the USHCA representatives then joined close to 200 guests from around the U.S. to attend an exclusive dinner at which President Xi delivered a significant speech in which he shared China's openness to cooperation and posed a crucial question: &quot;Are we partners or are we adversaries?&quot;

The Biden-Xi meeting and the special reception and dinner on that day have led to many recent positive developments in US-China relations. In this webinar, Susan Thornton, USHCA Vice-Chair, and one of the leading American experts on China, will lead a discussion about the 2024 prospects for U.S.-China ties based on their take-aways from the San Francisco meetings and their other interactions with U.S. and Chinese counterparts.

        Much of the US-China strategic rivalry in the last few years has played out as a struggle for technological supremacy. The Trump years were characterized by an unabashed abandonment of the discourse of free trade and international cooperation in favour of the language of “decoupling” and nationalism. This was accompanied by tariffs, import bans, and export controls, including pressure on non-US companies to adhere to US law, and was met with retaliatory measures from China. While the strident discourse between the two countries has seen ebbs and flows, the ongoing friction around technology access has had far reaching consequences. This panel aims to understand the direct and also indirect effects of the ongoing technology battles between the US and China. It is part of an ongoing series of panels organized by the India China Institute on emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older international order that used to be dominated by US leadership. Some of the issues that this panel will explore include: the impacts on companies which have had to “China-proof” or “US-proof” their operations; the redirecting of investments and shifting away of manufacturing away from China to other parts of the world; new geographies of technological innovation that include battles for supremacy in AI, biotech, smart cities, and climate change technologies; the impact on academic networks and flows of students and experts; and finally geopolitical consequences as governments have had to take sides in new infrastructural, technological and military alliances.

        Abstract: From the perspective of the maritime borderlands centered on the island of Tsushima, late medieval Japanese transformations in commercialization, local lordship, and the integration of the archipelago into domestic and East Asian shipping circuits all depended on flows of enslaved peoples. The history of Tsushima’s trafficking networks between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries helps explain the persistence of slavery in late medieval Japan by revealing motivations of traffickers. Slaving empowered cooperation among a cross-section of Tsushima society to form piracy enterprises (Ch.wokou,Kn.waegu, Jp.kaizoku). Lords of the island, the Sō family, integrated slavery into the administrative machinery of their territorial domain and incentivized military service with awards tied to trafficking. They shaped medieval discoursesof status and ethnicity that facilitated the objectification of captives into commodified “baseborn” (genin) and “exotics” (Tōjin) from China and the Korean peninsula, who Tsushima traffickers dealt locally and across the archipelago, including to the apex of the warrior hierarchy, the Ashikaga shogunate.For retainers, local elites, and commoner mariners, such sanctioned trafficking became a source of prestige and family legacies alongside othercommercial and violent enterprises. Incentivized by the promise of tax exemptions and other awards from the Sō, their piratical enterprisesraided Korean and Chinese coasts and engaged in military campaigns in Kyushu. Territorial bestowals across northern Kyushu turned sea-lanes into slave roads. This history invites reconsideration of trafficking in medieval Japan as a low-status, opportunistic, and declining trade.

        International negotiations about climate change have long been anchored in frameworks of carbon emissions and net-zero targets. However, this framing has not necessarily captured the most meaningful goals for many parts of the world that are coping with some of the most intense effects of climate change. Their concerns have centered around other issues such as the availability of water, the rise in extreme heat, air pollution, and shifts in patterns of biodiversity and agriculture. These issues are undoubtedly connected to emissions, and yet the dominant framework has often determined the production of knowledge, the determination of targets, and the design of interventions, in ways that have elided the concerns of different parts of the world. This panel will bring together scholars and practitioners from the Global South who will discuss the perspectives of climate change that are most trenchant in their parts of the world.

The panel is part of an ongoing series organized by the India China institute on emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older putatively liberal international order dominated by US leadership. By focusing on alternative frameworks, it seeks to broaden and make more representative differing ways of understanding and addressing climate change.

        The project 'Regionalizing Infrastructures in Chinese History' invites scholars of Chinese and European archaeology and history to participate in the international workshop 'Perspectives on the Materiality of City Walls in China and Europe'. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different archaeological contexts to share best practices in the analysis of archaeological knowledge production, to identify key issues within existing practices, and to explore approaches to materiality in archaeology by examining case studies from various geographical areas and historical eras.

Participants are invited to submit preliminary position papers (up to 5 pages) which will be discussed during the two sessions. Travel for participants will be covered within Europe.

Panel 1:Archaeological reporting(10.00 - 12.30)

How researchers engage with the materiality of city walls, the capacity of those walls to modify the perception and action of humans, depends often on local approaches to the material. On one hand, archeological reports serve as a starting point for reconstructing archaeological knowledge-making processes in different locations and, by extension, for discerning theoretical trends and dominant ideas in archaeological science. On the other hand, archaeology is notorious for the amount of gray literature it creates. How do we facilitate access to this information as archaeologists? How do we extract meaningful data from them?

The reports, both published and unpublished, create opportunities to discuss methodological approaches, different frameworks, as well as blind spots of archaeological reporting. This panel invites researchers to examine how the materiality of city walls shape the perception and action of archaeologists, policymakers, and others who engage with the material remains of city walls in the present by addressing, among others, the following questions:

● Are there local, regional, and national trends in archaeological research on city walls (and infrastructure in general)?

● Are city walls a priority in choosing sites? Are certain time periods given priority?

● Is research on city walls only driven from above (i.e. by new infrastructure development and state-sponsored tourism), or does some of it come from below?

● Can digital technologies facilitate local, regional, and global comparative investigations of material remains of city walls?

Panel 2:Materiality and communication(14.00-17.00)

Andrea Mubi Brighenti and Mattias Kärrhold, in their introduction toUrban Walls: Political and Cultural Meanings of Vertical Structures and Surfaces(2018),refer to walls asmaterial and semiotic technologies of inter- visibility managementand walling as atechnology of social interaction. In archaeological interpretations, city walls delineate ingroups and outgroups; they demonstrate seemingly clear borders between past and present regimes. In recent years the renewed interest in city walls as tourist attractions has made it so that city walls everywhere are treated as local/national symbols. City walls create bonds and barriers to this day; they are sources of safety and alienation, and in recent years walls are a source of revenue through tourism. They also influence city planning and community relations. This panel explores how city walls create social relations by examining, among others, the following questions:

● How are memories of city walls transmitted? What is the role of city walls in inculcating culture (generatinghabitus)?

● How are experiences of the materiality of city walls reflected in archaeological finds of different groups?

● How do city walls mediate the relationship between the sacred and the profane?

● How have city walls enabled infrastructural violence and inequality in the past? Do they have an impact on violence and inequality today?

● How can archaeological research into the materiality of city walls help us understand and address contemporary teichopolitics?

        ALTERNATIVE HYGIENIC MODERNITY: CHINESE MEDICAL THERAPY PROJECT FOR INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION IN COLD WAR TAIWAN

        The concept of Hygienic Modernity has been proposed for about 20 years. This talk takes the Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) poisoning event in Taiwan in the Cold War period as an example to revisit this well-known concept in the modern history of East Asia. The PCBs are incurable industrial toxicants and have caused environmental pollution and food poisoning from the U.S. to East Asia since the 1970s. I argue that this pollution in Taiwan was a transformative point when industrial toxicants became modern hygienic issues, and the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine treatments for PCBs became a new kind of modernity in the 1980s. Moreover, the Kuomintang (KMT) government constructed this integrated therapeutic method to tackle the hygienic and societal disorders caused by Western industrial modernity.

In the late period of the Cold War, difficult political situations at home and abroad posed the KMT government with numerous social movements in Taiwan. During the outbreak of PCBs poisonings and the following grassroots consumerism campaigns, Li-Fu Chen, an influential KMT politician, promoted the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine for PCBs therapy beneath the official propaganda of the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Movement (1966-1991). Interdisciplinary teams conducted both animal experiments and clinical trials to validate the therapeutic effectiveness of this project. Although the long-term outcome of Chinese medicine treatment was unsatisfactory, this project benefited the KMT government’s three political goals: alleviated societal panic, propagated Taiwan’s medical achievements to the West, and institutionalized the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine.
