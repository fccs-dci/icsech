        Chinese businesses employing tens of millions of people rely on property development— from steel to construction to banking. China’s property sector faced a crisis this past year, with talk of the bankruptcy of Evergrande and threats of a debt crisis and sharp slowdown in China’s overall economy. As China faces renewed covid lockdowns alongside official calls to keep GDP growth at 5.5% for 2022, how are changes in real estate markets affecting the growth and vitality of other businesses and sectors across China’s economy?

Please join experts on China’s real estate sector and macroeconomy for this discussion. Speakers’ presentations will be followed by Q&amp;amp;A.

        InRecharging China in War and Revolution, 1882 – 1955, Ying Jia Tan explores the fascinating politics of Chinese power consumption as electrical industries developed during seven decades of revolution and warfare. Tan traces this history from the textile-factory power shortages of the late Qing, through the struggle over China's electrical industries during its civil war, to the 1937 Japanese invasion that robbed China of 97 percent of its generative capacity. Along the way, he demonstrates that power industries became an integral part of the nation's military-industrial complex, showing how competing regimes asserted economic sovereignty through the nationalization of electricity. Based on a wide range of primary sources,Recharging China in War and Revolution, 1882 – 1955argues that, even in times of peace, the Chinese economy operated as though still at war, constructing power systems that met immediate demands but sacrificed efficiency and longevity.

        Rapid coastal development presents substantial risks to marine habitats, biodiversity and coastal communities dependent upon vital marine ecosystem services. Noting that China is now the world’s largest bilateral creditor of overseas development finance, Blake Alexander Simmons, Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Human Dimensions of Natural Resources at Colorado State University, will present a new study investigating the extent to which coastal development projects financed by Chinese development finance institutions present both direct and indirect risks to marine habitats, threatened species, marine protected areas and coastal Indigenous communities. Simmons will discuss where risks are greatest and how this knowledge can be used to create an agenda for “blue-ing” China’s overseas development finance portfolio.

Join us on Wednesday, May 18, for a discussion on mapping the risks of China’s global coastal development to marine socio-ecological systems. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.

        Later this May, the Biden administration is expected to unveil the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IEPF) – its signature economic and trade cooperation initiative for the Indo-Pacific region. The four-pillared framework will take the form of an “administrative arrangement” that “will not include new market access commitments” but will feature “high-standard outcomes” with a more “consultative” enforcement mechanism. The Framework clearly departs from the existing architecture of economic and trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific, as represented by the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Regional Economic Comprehensive Partnership (RCEP), and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).

What is the Biden administration’s thinking behind the launch of IPEF? Is the Framework the ‘real deal’ – a meaningful economic and trade liberalization initiative – or is it mostly about telegraphing good intentions of U.S. commitment to the region? How are East and Southeast Asian nations reacting to the Framework’s launch and contents? Is IPEF fit for purpose as a meaningful regional rules-setting undertaking? Or is it primarily a means to de-emphasize – and decouple – the role of China within existing Asian and trans-Pacific supply chains?

On Wednesday, May 18, please join the ICAS Trade ‘n Technology Program virtually for a hybrid expert panel discussion on the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and its implications for the United States’ relations in Asia.

        This talk explores the terrain of “Oriental Medicine” in a quintessentially American town: Nashville, Tennessee, home of the Grand Ole Opry and a birthplace of country music. The research excavates the origins of acupuncture in Tennessee and traces the personal journeys of practitioners who came to the American South from around the world. By seeing Chinese medicine embedded within this specific locale, we reveal the profound difficulty of finding “China” within the complex culture of American wellness.

        How did Maoism go global? This book talk forThe Emergence of Global Maoism: China’s Red Evangelism and the Cambodian Communist Movement, 1949-1979(Cornell University Press, 2022) explores the link between the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to globalize Maoism and the dialectical engagement of exported Maoism by intellectuals who became Maoists in Cambodia. It expands upon Edward Said’s concept of “Traveling Theory,” which identifies conditions of production, transmission, and reception, to explain how Maoism emerged in Cambodian intellectual circles. The book talk examines the intellectual journey of one of its Maoist intellectuals under analysis, Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) Minister of Information Hu Nim (aka.Comrade Phoas). During his studies in Paris in the 1950s and after trips to China in the 1960s, Hu founded the Khmer-Chinese Friendship Association (Samāgam Mittphāp Khmer-Chin) and served the Maoist CPK until his execution atTuol Sleng(S-21). The book talk emphasizes Hu’s story as one ofbecomingin which the central roles ofcommunityandnetworkpushed him towards radicalization. It also charts the course of Maoisms, global and local, by making broader sense of Hu Nim’s life and by referring to organizations in which he participated actively.

        For our May book club we’re readingKingdom of Charactersin preparation for our chat with the author, Jing Tsu.

--

After a meteoric rise, China today is one of the world’s most powerful nations. Just a century ago, it was a crumbling empire with literacy reserved for the elite few, as the world underwent a massive technological transformation that threatened to leave them behind. InKingdom of Characters, Jing Tsu argues that China’s most daunting challenge was a linguistic one: the century-long fight to make the formidable Chinese language accessible to the modern world of global trade and digital technology.

Kingdom of Charactersfollows the bold innovators who reinvented the Chinese language, among them an exiled reformer who risked a death sentence to advocate for Mandarin as a national language, a Chinese-Muslim poet who laid the groundwork for Chairman Mao’s phonetic writing system, and a computer engineer who devised input codes for Chinese characters on the lid of a teacup from the floor of a jail cell. Without their advances, China might have never become the dominating force we know today.

        CATCHING FIRE: HOW NATIONAL HUMILIATION SPREADS HOSTILE FOREIGN POLICY PREFERENCES ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA

        Researchers have linked a variety of emotions including anger, hatred, fear and humiliation to intergroup conflict attitudes. National humiliation has particularly come under scrutiny because of its influence on China's and Russia's foreign policies. Do emotional expressions of humiliation cause advocacy of hostile foreign policy positions and shape foreign policy debates? Further, how do emotions spread socially to become politically relevant? To answer these questions, Dr Masterson draws on group-based emotions theory and appraisal theory from psychology to construct a theory of political emotional contagion. To evaluate this theory, he uses supervised machine learning to measure the narratives of national humiliation and foreign policy positions in a large (more than 1.6 billion posts), nationally representative data set of Chinese social media posts. Dr Masterson finds that posts invoking narratives of national humiliation are more likely to support using military force, maintaining disputed territorial claims and raising trade barriers. He also finds evidence of emotional contagion as users sharing national humiliation narratives causes their followers to become more likely both to share such narratives in the future and to express support for hostile policy positions.

        FEELING PRECARIOUS IN CHINA

        On the evening of November 18th, 2017, a blaze broke out in the basement of a two-storey building in Xinjian urban village, located just outside Beijing’s Sixth Ring Road. At least 19 people, including 8 children, died in the flames. Yet in the days that followed locals had no chance to mourn: before the gutted building was even fully soused, the local authorities had issued a comprehensive eviction order for Xinjian. Using fire safety as its rationale, the city government condemned the entire settlement, and its inhabitants, perhaps as many as 250,000 of them, were forced to evacuate their homes. Xinjian had emblematized inequality and exclusion well before the fire and evictions of 2017, and its residents long counted among contemporary China’s most precarious people. What kind of change, then, might the evictions mark? Or to put this another way, what does it mean to be officially banished from a place of already de facto exile?

In this talk, I suggest that the evictions provoke questions about the limits of inequality, exclusion, and and insecure work as meaningful descriptors of social conditions in our times. These limits have prompted Saskia Sassen to argue that we are now witnessing “the emergence of new logics of expulsion” in the global political economy – forces which make the language we use to describe immiseration on a systematic scale too tepid and which compel a rethink of how we define precarity, surely a master concept for the present. In this talk, I explore the logic of expulsion in contemporary China, its capacity to foment both solidarity and social strife, and its relationship with cultural forms. In particular, I look at how people living under precarity in China today use culture as a space to vent feelings of rage, resentment, distrust, and disdain that are taboo under the diktats of so-called harmonious society.

        What constitutes being human? What are the boundaries or fuzzy edges of humanity? What can we learn from exploring the margins of humanity? These questions lie at the heart of this symposium, which will bring together twelve scholars across a variety of fields to consider how concepts analogous to our contemporary idea of “the human” were defined and debated in Medieval China.

We hope that the papers assembled for the symposium will open new, interdisciplinary vistas on the ways in which ethnocultural others, sociological underclasses, striking and different individuals, animals and gods, and ex- and future-humans were conceptualized and written about in the medieval period, and on the ways in which these marginal beings expressed and challenged the self-understandings of the authors of the materials that survive to us.

The symposium will be held via Zoom from 10am to 1pm, EST, on June 1st through June 3rd, 2022. Registration is free andopen to the public.

        Is China a “rogue donor” that uses its largesse to prop up corrupt and authoritarian regimes? Does Beijing bankroll politically motivated and economically inefficient ‘‘white elephants”? What are the risks of borrowing from Beijing? The existing debate about China’s overseas lending and grant-giving activities is largely guided by opinion and conjecture rather than rigorous evidence. In this talk, Dr. Parks will set the record straight with a new dataset of international development finance from China that captures 13,427 projects worth $843 billion across 165 countries over an 18-year period.

        Public health scholars and geographers examine healthcare inequalities using different approaches, leaving salient research gaps due to disciplinary divide. Through a presentation of three studies, we develop a synthesized approach to understand the multi-dimensional and multiscalar healthcare inequalities in urban China through combining the strengths of both public health and geography. The first study examines multi-scalar unevenness in the distribution of China’s high-quality healthcare resources and the underlying mechanisms. The second study investigates cross-city patient mobility in China and its impacts on healthcare equity and efficiency. The third study explores the divergent distributions of physicians and healthcare beds in China and the determinants. These three studies present a synthesized approach underpinned by an in-depth engagement with the complex healthcare system through geographical lenses. To conclude, we propose several ways to break disciplinary silos.
