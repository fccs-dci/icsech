        World Factory and After: Grass Stage and the Fate of Social Theater in Xi Jinping’s China

Sydney China Distinguished Fellow Presents X Talks in Chinese Humanities

The Shanghai-based Grass Stage theater troupe performed versions of World Factory at various venues in China, Hong Kong, and North America from 2014-2016. World Factory, a non-narrative, experimental documentary-based production, considered China’s new working class from historical, subjective, psychic, and social perspectives. Performances were also venues for intense and heated discussion with the audience. 2016, as the character of the Xi Jinping regime became more and more clear, marked an apogee not only for the performance, but for the Chinese worker’s movement in general. This talk traces Grass Stage’s trajectory from World Factory to the present, and uses that trajectory as a diagnosis of the state of political subjectivity and the fate of social critique.

Christopher Conneryis Professor in the Literature department at the University of California Santa Cruz, where he teaches Cultural Studies, Chinese Studies, and courses in Marxist and neoliberal theory. He has also served recently as Visiting Professor in the graduate department of Cultural Studies at Shanghai University. His research has involved four areas: early imperial Chinese culture and history (Empire of the Text: Writing and Authority in Early Imperial China ;contributions to theColumbia History of Chinese Literature) ; oceanic ideology and mythos in global capitalism (articles inboundary 2,Journal of Historical Geography,PMLA,Harvard Design Magazine, et al); the global 1960s (various anthologized articles, plus special issues ofboundary 2andInter-Asia Cultural Studies); and contemporary Chinese culture, ideology, and politics (articles inMade in China,boundary 2,New Left Review, et al). Since 2010 he has been involved as writer, performer, and political consultant in the Shanghai-based, Chinese-language social and experimental theater group Grass Stage, which has performed throughout China, as well as in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Macao, and North America.

As part of the Sydney China Distinguished Fellowship Program 2024, this event is co-hosted by theDiscipline of Chinese Studiesin the School of Languages and Cultures, theChina Studies Centreat the University of Sydney. The fellowship is enabled by the acuity of vision and generosity of Mr James Lee, a University of Sydney alumnus now based in Hong Kong. This event is part of our talks in Chinese Humanities, a monthly event that we present with the Australian Society for Asian Humanities at the UNSW Faculty of Arts, Design and Architecture's Judith Neilson Chair of Contemporary Art.

The presentation will introduce a collective research program carried over the last 5 years by a group of historians and sociologists examining workers’ experiences in Japan, France and Belgium during the 30-year post-war boom and in China from the 1980s to the present day. The originality of the program is that it uses the conditions of Chinese workers as a starting point to revise the standard narrative on the homogenisation of incomes and lifestyles, embodied in the idea of a growing middle class, followed by the de-standardization of labour (Ulrich Beck 1992, Robert Castel 1995).

The presentation will introduce how the comparison was carried in the two main outputs of the program:


	An online exhibition untitledWorkers of the World: Lives, Bodies, Strugglesthat gives visitors close insights into the reality of the working-class experiences. Visitors can access various written, audio, video, and image resources by exploring the three main sections (lives, bodies, struggles).

	A book to be published in 2024, Thomann B. &amp;amp; Guiheux G. (dir.),Comparing Labor in Contemporary China and in Post-war Japan and France.Precariousness in High-Growth Economies(Amsterdam University Press). The five chapters are thematic analyses blending in-depth micro perspectives based on extensive fieldwork in China, France and Japan with broader perspectives mobilising historical and political economic thought. The five chapters focus on payslips, workers' domestic economics, workers' demand recognition, arenas of negotiations, religion and ethics in the world of business.

        Urban inhabitants have long had an emotional attachment to the cities they live in. This expresses itself through daily life, culture, and heritage. This talk highlights some of the ways in which urban populations in China have reflected on their emotional attachment to the city. Examples includehuaigupoetry mourning the loss of Luoyang, guidebooks that waxed lyrical on the sites of Ming Dynasty Nanjing, and emotional appeals to create socialist production cities in Maoist China.

Within this broader context of emotional attachment to place, one of the issues that inspires the most vigorous responses is heritage. Study of the protection, use, and development of heritage assets often focuses on their economic value and the local and broader politics around specific sites. However, to the people who are most attached to heritage, it is the emotional connection that is the most important. This talk explores examples from Hong Kong, such as the Star Ferry. It sets these in a global context by thinking about how emotional attachment to heritage is guiding urban policy and planning. As rapid urbanization sweeps all before it in skyscrapers of steel and glass, I ask whether prioritising an emotional approach to heritage has the potential to create cities that are more accessible, equitable, and sustainable.

Theatre as Business: A study of the Triangular Relations among Shanxi Merchants’ business, Theatre Sponsorship and Social Status in Late Imperial China.

Shanxi merchants were one of the most powerful merchant groups that rose in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). In the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the late Qing in particular, Shanxi merchants’ business reached its peak. They dominated the market in northern China and established the first banking industry in the country. Apart from their enormous fortune, Shanxi merchants were also famous for their passion for xiqu and for their generous support to Shanxi regional theatre, especially clapper opera or bangzi 梆子. Shanxi merchants established stages in their guildhalls and mansions, invited Shanxi local troupes to perform at bustling market towns during their meetings and social gatherings, and entertained social elites with theatrical performances from time to time.

China was historically an agricultural society where literati ranked at the top of the traditional Chinese social hierarchy, while merchants were placed at the bottom, according to Confucian and Legalist ethos. This presentation reveals that the underlying reason for Shanxi merchants’ theatre sponsorship was their pursuit of wealth, influence, fame and higher social status. Theatre sponsorship helped Shanxi merchants achieve business success, maintain a close relationship with the ruling class, and obtain and manifest their newly acquired higher status.

This presentation also shows a divergence of opinions on the primary intention of merchants’ consumption of cultural products and engagement in cultural activities, which was social emulation by nature. The once-popular idea ‘merchants as déclassé and scholars as exalted’ came to be held by the literati alone and was a futile defence that merchants did not care much about at the dusk of the imperial era.

        &quot;GOOD WIFE, WISE MOTHER”: ASSIMILATING HAN TAIWANESE UNDER JAPANESE RULE

        &quot;Good Wife, Wise Mother”: Assimilating Han Taiwanese Under Japanese Rule

In 1897, two years after Japan began its half-century rise as an imperial power, it inaugurated an ambitious experiment to make modern Japanese citizens out of Han Taiwanese schoolgirls in its first overseas colony, Taiwan. The goal of the segregated education was to train Taiwanese boys and men to become government clerks and teachers, and girls and women to become “good wives, wise mothers” (ryōsai kenbo). This gendered education was part of dōka, the Japanese assimilation program, as it sought to make everyone in the empire “Japanese” as equals by teaching the Japanese language and imperial ethics with gendered roles. Constructed by engaging with the cult of domesticity in the West that envisioned the home as a private space for women and the workplace as a public space for men to build strong nation-states, “good wife, wise mother” emerged in Japan in the 1890s and was introduced to Taiwan in the same decade.

Using periodicals and Japanese language textbooks, I examine the discourse and implementation of this ideal womanhood in Taiwan. This ideal of womanhood was crucial to the civilizing mission of the colonizers. Japanese colonial authority used gender to increase the supposed distance of civilizational levels between the colonizer and the colonized. By introducing gender into the discussion on dōka in Taiwan, I show that the promise of equality and inclusion from dōka became even less attainable and thus slowed assimilation to the supposedly superior Japanese civilization when colonial officials and educators characterized the colonized as feminine and depicted colonized women as the symbol of Taiwan’s “backwardness.”

Gendered assimilation became almost attainable for the Taiwanese toward the end of World War II compared to the pre-war dōka efforts. Ethnic and class divisions were blurred during wartime mobilization as the colonial government expanded the responsibilities of schoolgirls and women, thus blurring the distinction between Taiwanese and Japanese. Wartime mobilization redefined gendered assimilation in colonial Taiwan, as it shifted the training and focus of “good wives, wise mothers”, from the individual households only, to the entire empire, which meant that schoolgirls were trained to become “good wives, wise mothers” of the empire.

        Since the normalization of US-China bilateral relationship 45 years ago, educational exchanges have brought many benefits to both countries. Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.

Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.

The U.S. China Agriculture Roundtable has grown to be the most broad-based bilateral dialogue platform around agriculture, drawing leaders spanning government, trade, business, education, and think tanks from both countries.

The upcoming 4th annual Roundtable will further strengthen bilateral collaboration and people-to-people friendships around agriculture. We are excited that two leading experts, Dr. Jennifer Turner and Dr. Karen Mancl of the Wilson Center will be joining us for our 2024 Think Tank Dialogue in Beijing on June 12th. The Wilson Center and the Ohio State University recently published a report to illustrate the complex climate footprint of U.S. and Chinese agriculture and highlight opportunities for bilateral cooperation on policies, projects, and strategies to reduce agriculture’s climate footprint.

At this talk, Dr. Turner and Dr. Mancl will discuss possible paths forward for climate and food collaboration between the United States and China. We will also hear from leading professionals in agrifood sciences and agricultural studies.
