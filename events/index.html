        Join us as Elizabeth Perry (Harvard University) explores China’s longest-lived mass movement: the Patriotic Health Campaign (PHC).Introduced by Mao Zedong in 1952 during the Korean War, the PHC continues even today, having recently played a role in Xi Jinping’s Zero-Covid effort. The talk will question the official characterization of the PHC as a “uniquely Chinese” approach to sanitation and epidemic control, noting the influence of the American Tuberculosis Movement and YMCA health campaigns, while at the same time emphasizing the central importance of public health in the legitimation of Chinese Communist rule, from revolutionary days to the present.

About the Speaker:

        On Wednesday, March 6 from 3:30 to 5pm in THO 317 and online, the UW Taiwan Studies Program will welcome Professor Niki Alsford to discuss his newest book entitledTaiwan Lives: A Social and Political History. Published by the University of Washington Press as the first book in theTaiwan and the Worldbook series supported by UW-TSP,Taiwan Livestraces Taiwan’s complex history through the lens of colonial influences from Austronesian expansion to the economic and democratic polity it is today.

Alsford explores this arc of history by recounting the life stories of its inhabitants.Taiwan Livesdelves into the lives of twenty-four individuals, including a merchant, exile, activist, pop star, doctor, and a president. These stories span different time periods, social classes, ethnic backgrounds, and political affiliations, yet all offer glimpses into the varied historical epochs and highlight the interconnectedness of colonialism.

        Abstract: From the perspective of the maritime borderlands centered on the island of Tsushima, late medieval Japanese transformations in commercialization, local lordship, and the integration of the archipelago into domestic and East Asian shipping circuits all depended on flows of enslaved peoples. The history of Tsushima’s trafficking networks between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries helps explain the persistence of slavery in late medieval Japan by revealing motivations of traffickers. Slaving empowered cooperation among a cross-section of Tsushima society to form piracy enterprises (Ch.wokou,Kn.waegu, Jp.kaizoku). Lords of the island, the Sō family, integrated slavery into the administrative machinery of their territorial domain and incentivized military service with awards tied to trafficking. They shaped medieval discoursesof status and ethnicity that facilitated the objectification of captives into commodified “baseborn” (genin) and “exotics” (Tōjin) from China and the Korean peninsula, who Tsushima traffickers dealt locally and across the archipelago, including to the apex of the warrior hierarchy, the Ashikaga shogunate.For retainers, local elites, and commoner mariners, such sanctioned trafficking became a source of prestige and family legacies alongside othercommercial and violent enterprises. Incentivized by the promise of tax exemptions and other awards from the Sō, their piratical enterprisesraided Korean and Chinese coasts and engaged in military campaigns in Kyushu. Territorial bestowals across northern Kyushu turned sea-lanes into slave roads. This history invites reconsideration of trafficking in medieval Japan as a low-status, opportunistic, and declining trade.

        1970s Hong Kong is usually remembered as a period of optimism, progress, and constructive reinvention. The MacLehose administration, the longest in the history of British Hong Kong, introduced a series of social reforms—free education, more housing projects, better social welfare, etc.—to regain local support following the social disturbances of 1966 and 1967. The well-publicised ‘Hongkong Clean Campaign,’ which ran for years in hopes of improving the city’s sanitation, was more than a call to sweep the city’s streets and housing estates clean. Delving into the anti-dog movement that climaxed during the campaign, my study sheds light on the darker side of Hong Kong’s progressive seventies. It aims to show that on the other side of the Hong Kong administration’s attempts to improve general sanitation, the city-wide cleanup saw the construction and subsequent purging of certain ‘undesirables.’ This resulted in the irrational slaughter of thousands of dogs and the restructuring of human-canine relations, particularly with the lumping of domesticated, stray, and feral dogs into the same category of ‘nuisance.’

        Sparks: China's Underground Historians and their Battle for the Future describes how some of China's best-known writers, filmmakers, and artists have overcome crackdowns and censorship to forge a nationwide movement that challenges the Communist Party on its most hallowed ground: its control of history. The past is a battleground in many countries, but in China it is crucial to political power. In traditional China, dynasties rewrote history to justify their rule by proving that their predecessors were unworthy of holding power. Marxism gave this a modern gloss, describing history as an unstoppable force heading toward Communism's triumph. The Chinese Communist Party builds on these ideas to whitewash its misdeeds and glorify its rule. Indeed, one of Xi Jinping's signature policies is the control of history, which he equates with the party's survival. But in recent years, a network of independent writers, artists, and filmmakers have begun challenging this state-led disremembering. Using digital technologies to bypass China's legendary surveillance state, their samizdat journals, guerilla media posts, and underground films document a regular pattern of disasters: from famines and purges of years past to ethnic clashes and virus outbreaks of the present--powerful and inspiring accounts that have underpinned recent protests in China against Xi Jinping's strongman rule. Based on years of first-hand research in Xi Jinping's China, Sparks challenges stereotypes of a China where the state has quashed all free thought, revealing instead a country engaged in one of humanity's great struggles of memory against forgetting—a battle that will shape the China that emerges in the mid-21st century.

        International negotiations about climate change have long been anchored in frameworks of carbon emissions and net-zero targets. However, this framing has not necessarily captured the most meaningful goals for many parts of the world that are coping with some of the most intense effects of climate change. Their concerns have centered around other issues such as the availability of water, the rise in extreme heat, air pollution, and shifts in patterns of biodiversity and agriculture. These issues are undoubtedly connected to emissions, and yet the dominant framework has often determined the production of knowledge, the determination of targets, and the design of interventions, in ways that have elided the concerns of different parts of the world. This panel will bring together scholars and practitioners from the Global South who will discuss the perspectives of climate change that are most trenchant in their parts of the world.

The panel is part of an ongoing series organized by the India China institute on emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older putatively liberal international order dominated by US leadership. By focusing on alternative frameworks, it seeks to broaden and make more representative differing ways of understanding and addressing climate change.

        PERSPECTIVES ON THE MATERIALITY OF CITY WALLS IN CHINA AND EUROPE

        The project 'Regionalizing Infrastructures in Chinese History' invites scholars of Chinese and European archaeology and history to participate in the international workshop 'Perspectives on the Materiality of City Walls in China and Europe'. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different archaeological contexts to share best practices in the analysis of archaeological knowledge production, to identify key issues within existing practices, and to explore approaches to materiality in archaeology by examining case studies from various geographical areas and historical eras.

Participants are invited to submit preliminary position papers (up to 5 pages) which will be discussed during the two sessions. Travel for participants will be covered within Europe.

Panel 1:Archaeological reporting(10.00 - 12.30)

How researchers engage with the materiality of city walls, the capacity of those walls to modify the perception and action of humans, depends often on local approaches to the material. On one hand, archeological reports serve as a starting point for reconstructing archaeological knowledge-making processes in different locations and, by extension, for discerning theoretical trends and dominant ideas in archaeological science. On the other hand, archaeology is notorious for the amount of gray literature it creates. How do we facilitate access to this information as archaeologists? How do we extract meaningful data from them?

The reports, both published and unpublished, create opportunities to discuss methodological approaches, different frameworks, as well as blind spots of archaeological reporting. This panel invites researchers to examine how the materiality of city walls shape the perception and action of archaeologists, policymakers, and others who engage with the material remains of city walls in the present by addressing, among others, the following questions:

● Are there local, regional, and national trends in archaeological research on city walls (and infrastructure in general)?

● Are city walls a priority in choosing sites? Are certain time periods given priority?

● Is research on city walls only driven from above (i.e. by new infrastructure development and state-sponsored tourism), or does some of it come from below?

● Can digital technologies facilitate local, regional, and global comparative investigations of material remains of city walls?

Panel 2:Materiality and communication(14.00-17.00)

Andrea Mubi Brighenti and Mattias Kärrhold, in their introduction toUrban Walls: Political and Cultural Meanings of Vertical Structures and Surfaces(2018),refer to walls asmaterial and semiotic technologies of inter- visibility managementand walling as atechnology of social interaction. In archaeological interpretations, city walls delineate ingroups and outgroups; they demonstrate seemingly clear borders between past and present regimes. In recent years the renewed interest in city walls as tourist attractions has made it so that city walls everywhere are treated as local/national symbols. City walls create bonds and barriers to this day; they are sources of safety and alienation, and in recent years walls are a source of revenue through tourism. They also influence city planning and community relations. This panel explores how city walls create social relations by examining, among others, the following questions:

● How are memories of city walls transmitted? What is the role of city walls in inculcating culture (generatinghabitus)?

● How are experiences of the materiality of city walls reflected in archaeological finds of different groups?

● How do city walls mediate the relationship between the sacred and the profane?

● How have city walls enabled infrastructural violence and inequality in the past? Do they have an impact on violence and inequality today?

● How can archaeological research into the materiality of city walls help us understand and address contemporary teichopolitics?

Deadline for abstracts (up to 200 words):December 1, 2023.

        ALTERNATIVE HYGIENIC MODERNITY: CHINESE MEDICAL THERAPY PROJECT FOR INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION IN COLD WAR TAIWAN

        The concept of Hygienic Modernity has been proposed for about 20 years. This talk takes the Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) poisoning event in Taiwan in the Cold War period as an example to revisit this well-known concept in the modern history of East Asia. The PCBs are incurable industrial toxicants and have caused environmental pollution and food poisoning from the U.S. to East Asia since the 1970s. I argue that this pollution in Taiwan was a transformative point when industrial toxicants became modern hygienic issues, and the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine treatments for PCBs became a new kind of modernity in the 1980s. Moreover, the Kuomintang (KMT) government constructed this integrated therapeutic method to tackle the hygienic and societal disorders caused by Western industrial modernity.

In the late period of the Cold War, difficult political situations at home and abroad posed the KMT government with numerous social movements in Taiwan. During the outbreak of PCBs poisonings and the following grassroots consumerism campaigns, Li-Fu Chen, an influential KMT politician, promoted the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine for PCBs therapy beneath the official propaganda of the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Movement (1966-1991). Interdisciplinary teams conducted both animal experiments and clinical trials to validate the therapeutic effectiveness of this project. Although the long-term outcome of Chinese medicine treatment was unsatisfactory, this project benefited the KMT government’s three political goals: alleviated societal panic, propagated Taiwan’s medical achievements to the West, and institutionalized the integration of Chinese medicine and biomedicine.
