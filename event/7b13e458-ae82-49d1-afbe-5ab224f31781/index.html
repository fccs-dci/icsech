<p><strong>Panel One: Domestic Politics</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bruce Dickson</strong></p>

<p>Professor Dickson received his B.A. in political science and English literature, his M.A. in Chinese Studies, and his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan. He joined the faculty of The George Washington University and the Elliott School in 1993.</p>

<p>Professor Dickson's research and teaching focus on political dynamics in China, especially the adaptability of the Chinese Communist Party and the regime it governs. In addition to courses on China, he also teaches on comparative politics and authoritarianism.</p>

<p>His current research examines the political consequences of economic reform in China, the Chinese Communist Party’s evolving strategy for survival, and the changing relationship between state and society. His research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation, the US Institute of Peace, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</p>

<p><strong>Iza Ding</strong></p>

<p>Professor Iza Ding is an Assistant Professor in the Political Science Department at the University of Pittsburgh, with a courtesy appointment in Public Policy at the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. In 2019-2020, she was a Visiting Assistant Professor in Political Science and a Visiting Associate at the International Institute at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>Professor Ding’s research explores the paradoxes and pushbacks attending economic, political, and cultural modernization, such as creative resistance against institutional rigidities, lingering moral traditions against legal development, enduring historical memories against rapid socioeconomic transformations, and humans' simultaneous degradation of nature and attachment to nature. Her book&nbsp;<em>The Performative State: Public Scrutiny and Environmental Governance in China</em>&nbsp;has been recently released by Cornell University Press.</p>

<p>Professor Ding received her Ph.D. in Government from Harvard University, and her B.A. in Political Science and Russian and Eastern European Studies from the University of Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>Jeffrey Ding</strong></p>

<p>Professor Jeffrey Ding is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at George Washington University. Previously, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, sponsored by Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>Professor Ding’s research agenda centers on technological change and international politics. His dissertation investigates how past technological revolutions influenced the rise and fall of great powers, with implications for U.S.-China competition in emerging technologies like AI. Other research projects tackle how states should identify strategic technologies, assessments of national scientific and technological capabilities, and interstate cooperation on nuclear safety and security technologies. His work has been published in Foreign Affairs, Security Studies, The Washington Post, and other outlets.</p>

<p>Professor Ding received his Ph.D. in 2021 from the University of Oxford, where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar. Previously, Profesor Ding worked as a researcher for Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology and Oxford's Centre for the Governance of AI at the University of Oxford. Growing up in Iowa City, he became a lifelong Hawkeye fan and attended the University of Iowa for his undergraduate studies.</p>
