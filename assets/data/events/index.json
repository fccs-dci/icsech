Engaging issues of colonial history, local norms, and the very ability to conceive of another or oneself as marriageable, the book rethinks cross-border marriage not only as a form of gendered migration, but also as a set of practices that constructs marriageable partners and imaginable marriages."}}},{"node":{"id":"b0185d6b-d574-40a9-8515-e6bfba6c3435","title":"Pirates and Publishers: A Social History of Copyright in Modern China","field_starting_time":"2020-11-06T01:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Dr. Fei-Hsien Wang (Indiana University Bloomington)</p>\n","value":"Dr. Fei-Hsien Wang (Indiana University Bloomington)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences, The University of Hong Kong</p>\n","value":"Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences, The University of Hong Kong"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>In Pirates and Publishers (Princeton University Press, 2019), Fei-Hsien Wang reveals the unknown social and cultural history of copyright in China from the 1890s through the 1950s, a time of profound sociopolitical changes.

It addresses two puzzling features of this poorly understood period of recent Chinese history: why did antagonistic factions form, and why did violence break out and prove so difficult to suppress?"}}},{"node":{"id":"65fc1bf9-ffe0-4c5f-8d49-8c0fe5a59816","title":"Romanticizing Physical Labor through New Marriage Law Propaganda Films in 1950s China","field_starting_time":"2020-11-11T21:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Xian Wang</p>\n","value":"Xian Wang"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Yale University- Council on East Asian Studies</p>\n","value":"Yale University- Council on East Asian Studies"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":null}},{"node":{"id":"a3cc4a53-246d-4b5b-9e7a-bf0704b631ae","title":"NEXTChina - Election 2020: A new era in U.S.- China relations?","field_starting_time":"2020-11-11T16:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Craig Allen, Kaiser Kuo, Jane Sun, Yasheng Huang, Susan Thornton, Yuen Yuen Ang, Jeremy Goldkorn, Joseph Zeng, James Green, Evan Feigenbaum,David Sandalow, Gary Rieschel, Alex Wang</p>\n","value":"Craig Allen, Kaiser Kuo, Jane Sun, Yasheng Huang, Susan Thornton, Yuen Yuen Ang, Jeremy Goldkorn, Joseph Zeng, James Green, Evan Feigenbaum,David Sandalow, Gary Rieschel, Alex Wang"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>SupChina</p>\n","value":"SupChina"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>By the time this online conference happens, one week will have passed since the election and the fate of the world’s next 4 years will have been sealed.<br />\nWhat will the results mean for China?

We ask what the implications of cold calling, debt collection scripts, automated messaging and Artificial Intelligence had for the moral performativity of debt collection and repayment?"}}},{"node":{"id":"a08ce2d4-57ac-494f-a0b5-8c1ca6abdc7f","title":"The Chinese Economy: New Policies, Challenges and Directions","field_starting_time":"2020-11-17T03:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Professor Xu Qiyuan (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Professor Zhuang Rui (University of International Business and Economics, Beijing), Professor David Dollar (John L Thornton China Centre, Brookings Institution)</p>\n","value":"Professor Xu Qiyuan (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Professor Zhuang Rui (University of International Business and Economics, Beijing), Professor David Dollar (John L Thornton China Centre, Brookings Institution)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre, Victoria University of Wellington</p>\n","value":"New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre, Victoria University of Wellington"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>2020 has been a challenging year for economic policymakers all over the world.

The talk explores heterogeneity in children’s experiences of growing up in these skipped generation families."}}},{"node":{"id":"1b5b79ea-30e3-426a-9bd1-9493fca2162a","title":"A Taste Of China Episode 4: Farm To Table In Guangdong","field_starting_time":"2021-01-20T02:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Mei Zhang (Founder of WildChina), Dorinda Elliott (SVP, Director of Programs and Center for Business at the China Institute), Matilda Ho (Founder of Bits x Bites), Fred Young (Founder of Rainbow of Hope), Xiong Guilin (Organic Mushroom Farmer in Guangdong)</p>\n","value":"Mei Zhang (Founder of WildChina), Dorinda Elliott (SVP, Director of Programs and Center for Business at the China Institute), Matilda Ho (Founder of Bits x Bites), Fred Young (Founder of Rainbow of Hope), Xiong Guilin (Organic Mushroom Farmer in Guangdong)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>WildChina, China Institute</p>\n","value":"WildChina, China Institute"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>Travel live with us to Guangdong, to explore the rise of one of the most important sustainable agriculture movements on the planet.

By examining the policy process, market dynamics and crisis management in the evolution of China’s 2015 – 2016 stock market crashes, it identifies the endogenous dilemmas of regulatory elasticity and campaign-style enforcement in China’s hybrid regulatory regime."}}},{"node":{"id":"1201dace-cc32-4cc1-b4b1-867158b3e00e","title":"China-Latin America and the Caribbean: Infrastructure, Connectivity, and Everyday Life","field_starting_time":"2021-01-26T14:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Ariel C.

He will explain why China presents the WTO with a unique challenge, and how judicious reforms could save the WTO regime."}}},{"node":{"id":"a7f29603-5634-4722-8fba-a174f4074717","title":"China Made: the techno-politics, materialities, and legacies of infrastructure development","field_starting_time":"2021-02-10T15:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Timothy Oakes<br />\n(Professor of Geography and Director of the Center for Asian Studies<br />\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder),</p>\n<p>Alessandro Rippa<br />\n(Associate Professor of Chinese Studies<br />\nTallinn University),</p>\n<p>Darren Byler<br />\n(Postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Asian Studies<br />\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder),</p>\n<p>Dorothy Tang<br />\n(Landscape architect and Doctoral student at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning)</p>\n","value":"Timothy Oakes\n(Professor of Geography and Director of the Center for Asian Studies\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder),\n\nAlessandro Rippa\n(Associate Professor of Chinese Studies\nTallinn University),\n\nDarren Byler\n(Postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Asian Studies\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder),\n\nDorothy Tang\n(Landscape architect and Doctoral student at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>India China Institute</p>\n","value":"India China Institute"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>The China Made project seeks to build an innovative research agenda for an infrastructural approach in the China Studies field.

Together, these stories point toward a more flexible and globally oriented conceptualization of the history of capitalism in China and India."}}},{"node":{"id":"d6286836-0e7a-49f8-8350-45fa2070e840","title":"Why Xie Lingyun (385-433)?","field_starting_time":"2021-03-03T19:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Ping Wang (University of Washington)</p>\n","value":"Ping Wang (University of Washington)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Yale University Council on East Asian Studies</p>\n","value":"Yale University Council on East Asian Studies"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":null}},{"node":{"id":"94a7764d-5407-4ff0-8024-d1cff0f3dcd4","title":"Connecting the Dots: A History of Systems Thinking in Chinese Agricultural Science and Politics","field_starting_time":"2021-03-03T12:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Professor Sigrid Schmalzer (University of Massachusetts Amherst)</p>\n","value":"Professor Sigrid Schmalzer (University of Massachusetts Amherst)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (The University of Hong Kong)</p>\n","value":"Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (The University of Hong Kong)"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>Chinese agricultural scientists are prominent actors in global movements to promote agroecological engineering and preserve agricultural heritage systems.

Since Xi Jinping’s rise to power, scholars and policymakers are increasingly concerned that erosion of collective leadership in China might lead to foreign policy blunders.

The final section returns to the question of locations of China by evaluating competing positions on world literature in China and the West as well as interrogating what the periodic refashioning of literary studies in the West would mean to Chinese literature as world literature."}}},{"node":{"id":"5d962868-0c09-43a4-9c25-36c077fd4bfc","title":"Wang Chong 王充 (b.27) on Evidence, Pattern, and the Solid Ground of Knowing","field_starting_time":"2021-03-25T05:15:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Esther Klein (ANU, School of Culture, History and Language)</p>\n","value":"Esther Klein (ANU, School of Culture, History and Language)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>ANU - Australian Centre on China in the World</p>\n","value":"ANU - Australian Centre on China in the World"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>The Lunheng 論衡 is known to tradition as a cantankerous, mud-slinging sort of text.

Part of this effort included a collaboration with Beijing’s Studio Atlas in order to platform the hand-made indigo textiles unique to the Dong minority – both to preserve this ancient tradition and to make it accessible in the modern-day market across China."}}},{"node":{"id":"b96c1eaf-5ba4-4750-9b9b-6fbdbcc19cea","title":"Remains of the Everyday: A Century of Recycling in Beijing","field_starting_time":"2021-04-15T23:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Joshua Goldstein (USC)</p>\n","value":"Joshua Goldstein (USC)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>21st Century China Center, UC San Diego</p>\n","value":"21st Century China Center, UC San Diego"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>Joshua Goldstein of USC presents his new book looking at the history of the recycling industry in China. “Remains of the Everyday” traces the changing material culture and industrial ecology of China through the lens of recycling.</p>\n<p>Over the last century, waste recovery and secondhand goods markets have been integral to Beijing’s economic functioning and cultural identity, and acts of recycling have figured centrally in the ideological imagination of modernity and citizenship.</p>\n<p>The result, Goldstein argues, is the repeatedly re-inscribed exclusion of waste workers from formations of modern urban citizenship as well as the intrinsic liminality of recycling itself as an economic process.</p>\n","value":"Joshua Goldstein of USC presents his new book looking at the history of the recycling industry in China. “Remains of the Everyday” traces the changing material culture and industrial ecology of China through the lens of recycling.\n\nOver the last century, waste recovery and secondhand goods markets have been integral to Beijing’s economic functioning and cultural identity, and acts of recycling have figured centrally in the ideological imagination of modernity and citizenship.\n\nThe result, Goldstein argues, is the repeatedly re-inscribed exclusion of waste workers from formations of modern urban citizenship as well as the intrinsic liminality of recycling itself as an economic process."}}},{"node":{"id":"77861df3-4567-4c91-b35f-74d699ca397c","title":"Facing the New Geopolitics: China at the Poles","field_starting_time":"2021-04-15T23:30:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Featuring Anne-Marie Brady, Professor, China Studies, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and moderated by Leela Fernandes, UW Jackson School of International Studies Director and Stanley D.

It also explores how the project, which consumed enormous resources and labor, was built in 10 months to meet the government’s deadline to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the ‘New China,’ at the very moment that China was experiencing one of its most dire socioeconomic crises."}}},{"node":{"id":"bf11e79d-b900-4082-b6f1-83fb3a9b519a","title":"大学沙龙｜中国金融对外开放和人民币国际化","field_starting_time":"2021-04-24T13:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>周诚君(中国人民银行金融研究所),高占军(哈佛大学),谭英绮(哈佛大学)</p>\n","value":"周诚君(中国人民银行金融研究所),高占军(哈佛大学),谭英绮(哈佛大学)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>University Forum</p>\n","value":"University Forum"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>十四届五中全会明确的“高质量双循环新发展格局”下，围绕人民币国际化的历程、阶段性和下一步前景展望，分析中国金融对外开放、资本项目可兑换以及货币政策框架转型的战略选择。搜索“大学沙龙”微信公众号，参加本次讲座。</p>\n","value":"十四届五中全会明确的“高质量双循环新发展格局”下，围绕人民币国际化的历程、阶段性和下一步前景展望，分析中国金融对外开放、资本项目可兑换以及货币政策框架转型的战略选择。搜索“大学沙龙”微信公众号，参加本次讲座。"}}},{"node":{"id":"9815eb1a-b511-4617-aaab-d3e3ad5a2cf9","title":"The Bamboo Ceiling","field_starting_time":"2021-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Jackson Lu (MIT Sloan School of Management)</p>\n","value":"Jackson Lu (MIT Sloan School of Management)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>MIT Sloan School/MIT School of Architecture and Planning</p>\n","value":"MIT Sloan School/MIT School of Architecture and Planning"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>The MIT China Seminar is co-organized by Professor Yasheng Huang of the Sloan School and Professor Siqi Zheng of the School of Architecture and Planning.

However, despite successfully mobilizing companies, banks and local officials to rapidly expand trade and investment abroad, Chinese leaders largely failed to influence key policy decisions overseas. Economic engagement with China thus yields more benefits with fewer costs than generally assumed. Orchestration concludes by placing China in comparative perspective, laying the foundation for a new research field: comparative economic statecraft."}}},{"node":{"id":"ca28fcf5-bf77-48ea-be24-9beca18f2986","title":"More Than Sharp Power: How the CCP Penetrates Taiwan and Hong Kong","field_starting_time":"2021-05-11T23:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>:&quot;Andy Nathan&quot; &quot;Jieh-min Wu&quot; &quot;Ngok Ma&quot;</p>\n","value":":\"Andy Nathan\" \"Jieh-min Wu\" \"Ngok Ma\""},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Hoover Institution, Stanford University</p>\n","value":"Hoover Institution, Stanford University"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>More Than Sharp Power: How the CCP Penetrates Taiwan and Hong Kong</p>\n<p>Called “canaries in the coal mine,” Hong Kong and Taiwan have been at the forefront of the CCP&#039;s sharp power play.

The book explores how China and India govern their cities and how their different styles of governance produce inequality and exclusion. Drawing upon historical-comparative analyses and extensive fieldwork (in Beijing, Guangzhou, Wukan, Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata), the book investigates the ways that Chinese and Indian cities manage land acquisition, slum clearance, and air pollution.

The book explores how China and India govern their cities and how their different styles of governance produce inequality and exclusion. Drawing upon historical-comparative analyses and extensive fieldwork (in Beijing, Guangzhou, Wukan, Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata), the book investigates the ways that Chinese and Indian cities manage land acquisition, slum clearance, and air pollution.

It shows how the militarization of Chinese industrialization linked millions of everyday lives to the global Cold War, merging global geopolitics with local change."}}},{"node":{"id":"510d4a16-6063-4ecb-a857-130c4df0c146","title":"Connecting the World-Island: What will China’s PEACE cable bring to Pakistan and East Africa?","field_starting_time":"2021-10-29T14:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Motolani Agbebi (University of Tampere; Finland), Tayyab Safdar (University of Virginia), Roxana Vatanparast (Columbia Law School), Nargis Kassenova (Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies), James Gethyn Evans (Harvard University)</p>\n","value":"Motolani Agbebi (University of Tampere; Finland), Tayyab Safdar (University of Virginia), Roxana Vatanparast (Columbia Law School), Nargis Kassenova (Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies), James Gethyn Evans (Harvard University)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Harvard University Fairbank Center For Chinese Studies</p>\n","value":"Harvard University Fairbank Center For Chinese Studies"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>China’s Hengtong Group—leading a consortium of telecom companies from Hong Kong, Pakistan, and East Africa—will soon complete installation of the Pakistan East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) cable.

Aging, Sun argues, is a global issue and must be reconsidered in a cross-border environment."}}},{"node":{"id":"4f3ac699-0da4-4671-b3b3-f806c6bf8e07","title":"Classical Learning and the Politics of the Common Good in Early China","field_starting_time":"2021-11-04T17:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Professor Michael Nylan (University of California, Berkeley)</p>\n","value":"Professor Michael Nylan (University of California, Berkeley)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>University of Oxford China Centre</p>\n","value":"University of Oxford China Centre"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>Recent work on the Documents classic has led Professor Nylan to return to her initial interests in Chinese history and what propelled her to be a Han historian, and specifically what institutions (domestic and official) are needed for human beings to flourish and for the court to claim legitimacy for most of its subjects?

The upshot is that theoretically even a minor dispute can grow into a major conflict due to swelling stakes, especially when dispute inflation spirals.

This paper examines the phenomenon of dispute inflation – wherein a contest over an object or issue assumes ever greater stakes and significance for its protagonists – and identifies three different mechanisms that can generate increasing non-material stakes. The upshot is that theoretically even a minor dispute can grow into a major conflict due to swelling stakes, especially when dispute inflation spirals. To illustrate these dynamics at work, this paper looks to recent developments in the dispute between the People’s Republic of China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands."}}},{"node":{"id":"d1b14374-14a5-465f-b0db-afa4ff448cff","title":"Book launch \"Creating China's Climate Change Policy\"","field_starting_time":"2021-11-23T18:30:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Olivia Gippner (European Commission)</p>\n","value":"Olivia Gippner (European Commission)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Berlin Contemporary China Network</p>\n","value":"Berlin Contemporary China Network"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":null}},{"node":{"id":"80dc40ca-5254-4318-bf50-3df3a534511b","title":"China’s Civilian Army: The Making of Wolf Warrior Diplomacy","field_starting_time":"2021-11-23T12:30:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>Peter Martin (Bloomberg News)</p>\n","value":"Peter Martin (Bloomberg News)"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Manchester China Institute, University of Manchester</p>\n","value":"Manchester China Institute, University of Manchester"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>Please join the Manchester China Institute for a book launch of Peter Martin’s China’s Civilian Army: The Making of Wolf Warrior Diplomacy.

Drawing on his recent book, Manfred Elfstrom will use extensive fieldwork and statistical analysis to examine both the causes and consequences of protest in “the workshop of the world.” Instead of taking sides in the old debate over whether non-democracies like China’s are on the verge of collapse or have instead found ways of maintaining their power indefinitely, he will explore the daily evolution of autocratic rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manfred Elfstrom</strong>&nbsp;is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics, Philosophy, and Political Science at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan.

Through unpacking the layers of this site, I will demonstrate how a liminal temporality of religious joy is materialized.</p>\r\n"}}},{"node":{"id":"b38c3222-fe9a-40c5-9517-1eb64c285536","title":"CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING CHINA SERIES FEATURING XINGXING WANG – CHINESE POLICY TOWARD NORTH KOREA","field_starting_time":"2022-03-02T14:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<div class=\"field__label\">Speakers</div>\n\n<div class=\"field__item\">\n<p><strong>Speaker: Xingxing Wang</strong>, Shanghai International Studies University<br />\n<strong>Moderator: William Overholt,&nbsp;</strong>Harvard Kennedy School</p>\n</div>\n","value":"<div class=\"field__label\">Speakers</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"field__item\">\r\n<p><strong>Speaker: Xingxing Wang</strong>, Shanghai International Studies University<br />\r\n<strong>Moderator: William Overholt,&nbsp;</strong>Harvard Kennedy School</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies</p>\n\n<p><em>Co-sponsored by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://korea.fas.harvard.edu/\">Korea Institute, Harvard University.</a></em></p>\n","value":"<p>Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Co-sponsored by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://korea.fas.harvard.edu/\">Korea Institute, Harvard University.</a></em></p>\r\n"},"field_event_mode":"Online","field_event_category":"Talk","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>Over the last decade, Dr. Wang has conducted research at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University—among several other universities in South Korea— Her research primarily concerns Northeast Asian studies, particularly focusing on the intersection between China, the Korean Peninsula and China-U.S. relations.</p>\n","value":"<p>Over the last decade, Dr. Wang has conducted research at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University—among several other universities in South Korea— Her research primarily concerns Northeast Asian studies, particularly focusing on the intersection between China, the Korean Peninsula and China-U.S. relations.</p>\r\n"}}},{"node":{"id":"6141f4ae-0a14-4a44-a716-361d8989be1c","title":"CEAS East-Southeast Asia Colloquium: \"International Conference, Transnational Networks and Chinese Buddhist Diplomacy in Thailand\"","field_starting_time":"2022-02-22T22:15:16+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p><strong>Thomas Borchert, Professor, The University of Vermont&nbsp;</strong></p>\n","value":"<p><strong>Thomas Borchert, Professor, The University of Vermont&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n"},"field_organizers":{"processed":"<p>The Center for East Asian Studies at The University of Pennsylvania</p>\n","value":"<p>The Center for East Asian Studies at The University of Pennsylvania</p>\r\n"},"field_event_mode":"Hybrid","field_event_category":"","field_registration":true,"field_description":{"processed":"<p>**This event will also be live streamed via Zoom.

Unlike previous nuclear modernization phases, the current upgrade is highly visible on commercial satellite images, which allows the public to participate in the debate about the nature and implications of Chinese nuclear forces in a way that has never been possible before. Dr. Hans Kristensen will outline his work on monitoring Chinese nuclear forces via analysis of satellite images and production of the Nuclear Notebook and discuss potential implications for Chinese nuclear strategy and policy. Mr. Prasad will examine the implications of China’s nuclear modernisation for India and India’s response. </span></p>\r\n"}}},{"node":{"id":"8ca03deb-a460-4327-9746-921a6e87ed08","title":"Cadre Country: How China became the Chinese Communist Party","field_starting_time":"2022-03-16T21:00:00+00:00","field_speakers":{"processed":"<p>\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\nJohn Fitzgerald is an Emeritus Professor at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.

This presentation will show that small and weak states as Cabo Verde can still enjoy some agency in their relations with great powers, an agency that allows them to balance their relationships and optimise their interests.</p>\r\n"}}},{"node":{"id":"34bbfeb7-a50f-412c-9801-f17360eac81b","title":"The Buried Truth?

The book is particularly oriented toward the role of politics—especially political parties—in the establishment, administration, architectural design, and historical narratives of museums. It is framed around the wrangling between the “blue camp” (the Nationalist Party, or KMT, and its supporters) and the “green camp” (Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, and its supporters) over what facets of the past should be remembered and how they should be displayed in museums. Organized into chapters focused on particular types of museums and memorial spaces (e.g., archaeology museums, history museums, martyrs’ shrines, war museums, memorial halls, literature museums, ethnology museums, and ecomuseums), the book presents a broad overview of the state of museums in Taiwan in the past three decades. The case of Taiwan museums tells us much about Cold War politics and its legacy in East Asia; the role of culture, history, and memory in shaping identities in the “postcolonial” landscape of Taiwan; the politics of historical memory in an emergent democracy, especially in counterpoint to the politics of museums in the People’s Republic of China, which continues to be an authoritarian single party state; and the place of museums in a neoliberal economic climate. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1.6363636363636362; margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-family:Roboto,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\">Kirk Denton</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-family:Roboto,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"> is Professor Emeritus of Chinese literature at Ohio State University.

The book is particularly oriented toward the role of politics—especially political parties—in the establishment, administration, architectural design, and historical narratives of museums. It is framed around the wrangling between the “blue camp” (the Nationalist Party, or KMT, and its supporters) and the “green camp” (Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, and its supporters) over what facets of the past should be remembered and how they should be displayed in museums. Organized into chapters focused on particular types of museums and memorial spaces (e.g., archaeology museums, history museums, martyrs’ shrines, war museums, memorial halls, literature museums, ethnology museums, and ecomuseums), the book presents a broad overview of the state of museums in Taiwan in the past three decades. The case of Taiwan museums tells us much about Cold War politics and its legacy in East Asia; the role of culture, history, and memory in shaping identities in the “postcolonial” landscape of Taiwan; the politics of historical memory in an emergent democracy, especially in counterpoint to the politics of museums in the People’s Republic of China, which continues to be an authoritarian single party state; and the place of museums in a neoliberal economic climate. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.6363636363636362; margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-family:Roboto,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\">Kirk Denton</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-family:Roboto,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"> is Professor Emeritus of Chinese literature at Ohio State University.

Her work has received numerous awards, including from the James Beard Foundation and the IACP (International Association of Culinary Professionals).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucas Sin, Chef and Co-Founder of Nice Day and junzi kitchen, opened his first restaurant when he was 16 in an abandoned newspaper factory in his hometown of Hong Kong. Despite spending his Yale undergraduate years in the Cognitive Science and English departments, Lucas spent his weekends running restaurants out of his dorm, known as Y Pop-up. Prior to junzi kitchen and Nice Day, Lucas cooked at Modernist Cuisine in Seattle, Kikunoi Honten in Kyoto, and Michelin-starred kitchens in Hong Kong and New York. Lucas has been named a Star Chef Rising Star, an Eater Young Gun, Forbes 30 under 30, and a Food and Wine Best New Chef.&nbsp;Beyond junzi and Nice Day's daily menu, Lucas curates a collaborative tasting menu exploring the narrative of Chinese culinary history in relation to other cultures of the world, which became a project known as Distance Dining during the COVID-19 pandemic. With Eric Sze, chef of Taiwanese restaurant 886, Lucas co-founded SHY*BOYZCLUB, an introverted Asian pop-up collective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xiaowei R. Wang is an artist, writer, organizer, and coder.

Yet in the days that followed locals had no chance to mourn: before the gutted building was even fully soused, the local authorities had issued a comprehensive eviction order for Xinjian.

While those two conventional views have some truth to them, they do not fully grasp the complexities of Chinese elite politics or the role of ideology in today’s China. The CCP has always been an extraordinarily leader-friendly system, and claims that Xi is rejecting Deng Xiaoping’s institutionalist leadership model do not reflect the new historiography on Deng’s tenure as China’s leader. And although Xi Jinping clearly believes that only devotion and conviction among party members can save the CCP, his experiences under the Mao era suggest a distaste and skepticism for radical politics.

He studies elite politics and foreign relations in China and Russia.</p>\n","value":"<p data-key=\"3\">Xi Jinping is often described as a fundamentally new kind of leader in Chinese politics – one who has ended a tradition of collective leadership and returned to a Maoist ideological agenda. While those two conventional views have some truth to them, they do not fully grasp the complexities of Chinese elite politics or the role of ideology in today’s China. The CCP has always been an extraordinarily leader-friendly system, and claims that Xi is rejecting Deng Xiaoping’s institutionalist leadership model do not reflect the new historiography on Deng’s tenure as China’s leader. And although Xi Jinping clearly believes that only devotion and conviction among party members can save the CCP, his experiences under the Mao era suggest a distaste and skepticism for radical politics. Xi’s approach to ideology indicates the pursuit of both a new and middle path: one that tries to maintain the economic vitality of Reform and Opening while drawing selectively upon an earlier era to address the challenges those years of economic reform have brought to regime stability. And given the nature of the CCP as a system in which power tends to flow down, not up, it is highly unlikely that a coalition within the elite will force a course correction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p
