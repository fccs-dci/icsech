But Xu argues that governments must win people’s hearts and minds through sympathetic, meaningful words and actions about their reactions, accountability, and visions, in addition to their supplies, funds, and managerial actions. Drawing on the dramaturgical approach and a comparative study, Xu shows how the two governments’ cultural responses have been shaped by their different types of regimes, political structures, and particular situations. Xu also intends to develop and extend the dramaturgical approach to disaster management, a topic that has been studied mostly from the managerial and practical perspective in the mainstream paradigm.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sociology.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/xu-bin.html\" rel=\"noopener\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">Bin Xu</a>&nbsp;is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Emory University.
