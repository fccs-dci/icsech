Comparative politics, foreign policy, rational choice, and South Asia are among my areas of interest. I had already ‘encountered’ China twice, in 1962 and 1971, but the chance to be actually in the country, and to speak to Chinese diplomats and scholars, and encounter society in the context of its everyday life, came to me in 2012 when I was invited to Tsinghua University to deliver a set of lectures on India’s foreign policy and domestic politics. During this visit, I was able to spend time in a Chinese village with a Muslim minority population which gave me a unique opportunity to observe the political system at the micro-level. It also gave me a point of comparison for my earlier experience of fieldwork at the village level in Odisha and Gujarat. The four areas of my academic repertoire where I feel the presence of China the most, and which I will discuss, are: 1. statecraft and foreign policy; 2. governance by stealth; 3. endogenous modernity; and 4. the modern state with Asian features. My interaction with the Chinese in China, and in Germany, has also helped me realise why pragmatism and unsentimental lucidity is a far better way forward in dealing with China than the sentimental Hindi-Chini-Bhai-bhai, and any exaggerated sense of mutual convergence of interests.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
