How has China been able to craft a formidable, multi-dimensional relationship with Africa within three decades? What are its key features? This seminar attempts to assess reactions to China's Africa record, on the continent and beyond. Another objective is to examine the nature of competition, if any, between China and India in Africa. The eventual goal is to highlight suitable takeaways for consideration by those who are responsible for framing and implementing India's Africa policy.</span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
