It is not about Korea reactively responding to a certain country or a certain international trend. Rather, it is about Korea proactively reaching out to the Indo-Pacific region and taking on a bigger role and responsibility. Korea is now a vibrant democracy that cherishes universal norms and values, which are prerequisites for great and innovative ideas to flourish. We aspire to work with all countries that share our vision for a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, so as to promote a rules-based international order based on universal values. What makes our Indo-Pacific strategy unique is our narrative of national development. Korea is the only country to rise up from being among the world’s poorest country to become an OECD donor country. Korea is ready to share the experiences and knowledge accumulated so far, and help meet the aspirations of the countries in the region to achieve national development and economic growth. Needless to say, India is one of the most important partners in implementing our Indo-Pacific strategy. This year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. Moreover, this year India has assumed the presidency of G20, and Korea is ready to fully support India for the success of the upcoming G20 summit.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
