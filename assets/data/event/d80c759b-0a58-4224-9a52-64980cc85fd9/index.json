The musical depicts a historical moment of diversity, equity, inclusion, tolerance, and cultural exchange. People with different cultural backgrounds find unity through powerful stories and songs as well as live instrumental music in classical, jazz, traditional Chinese, and Jewish music genres. For Xiang “Sean” Gao, the producer and composer of Shanghai Sonatas, who conceptualized the musical based on historical facts, this is a personal story. His grandfather was among the Chinese classical musicians influenced by the Jewish refugees, starting the family’s path of musical success and Gao’s ultimate status as one of the most successful violinists and pedagogues in America.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
