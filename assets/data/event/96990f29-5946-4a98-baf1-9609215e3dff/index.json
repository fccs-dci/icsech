Using the Wang family account book from Yi County (or Yixian), Professor Peng analyzes the employment of agricultural workers in traditional rural areas, focusing on the work account in the Wang family documents from the four towns of Yi County during the late Qing period.</p>\n\n<p>To establish the authenticity of the account book, Professor Peng first confirmed that it was written by a landlord Wang Fojin, who engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry. He then cross-referenced it with a series of other documents, such as the Wang family's account book on seedling pigs, lime invoices, and letters. Based on the records of work types in the account book, Professor Peng studied the rhythms of local agricultural production and corresponding employment activities. He demonstrates, through classification statistics, that women had a relatively high proportion of employment in various agricultural jobs, and that there was no significant difference in wages between male and female workers. These findings significantly surpass the existing understanding in the literature.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Professor Peng will elaborate in detail on the significance of stable social and economic relationships, such as tenancy and kinship, on the Wang family's daily employment. He will explain how commercial and reciprocal relationships were unified in the Wang family's management.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
