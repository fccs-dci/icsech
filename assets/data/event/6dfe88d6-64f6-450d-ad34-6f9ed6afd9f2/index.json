They have always been on the move. Why did Buddhist monks migrate from China to Southeast Asia? How did they participate in transregional Buddhist networks across the South China Sea? In this talk, I will tell the story of “South China Sea Buddhism,” referring to a Buddhism that emerged from a swirl of correspondence networks, forced exiles, voluntary visits, evangelizing missions, institution-building campaigns, and organizational efforts of countless Chinese and Chinese diasporic Buddhist monks. Drawing on multilingual research conducted in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, I challenge the conventional categories of “Chinese Buddhism” and “Southeast Asian Buddhism” by focusing on the lesser-known—yet no less significant—Chinese Buddhist communities of maritime Southeast Asia. By crossing the artificial spatial frontier between China and Southeast Asia, this talk brings Southeast Asia into the study of Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism into the study of Southeast Asia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jack Meng-Tat Chia</strong>&nbsp;is Assistant Professor of History and Religious Studies at the National University of Singapore. He specializes in Buddhism in maritime Southeast Asia and has broader research interests in migration, diasporas, transnationalism, pilgrimage, and religious diplomacy.

He has also published articles in journals such as&nbsp;<em>Asian Ethnology, China Quarterly, Contemporary Buddhism, Critical Asian Studies, History of Religions,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Journal of Chinese Religions</em>. He is currently working on two book projects:&nbsp;<em>Beyond the Borobudur: Buddhism in Postcolonial Indonesia</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Diplomatic Dharma: Buddhist Diplomacy in Modern Asia.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The ANU China Seminar Series is supported by the Australian Centre on China in the World at The Australian National University’s College of Asia &amp; the Pacific.</em></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
