China and India are exemplars of just one constant determinant - divergences. As states with the rubric of civilizational continuum, their Westphalian expressions have embedded characteristics of deep misgivings about the ‘other.’ The bilateral between the two countries brings forth aspects of institutional and political differences, where society is co-opted into a discourse where ‘otherness’ prevails over the conspicuous rational. This makes the China-India bilateral a unique extant where vacuous space exists, with the ‘formal’ prevailing over nascent ‘informal’. What can be done? For scholars of the bilateral, ongoing narratives are dominated by a tone where ‘alternate’ is considered obtuse and refutable. More than seven decades of Westphalian geographical neighbourliness has not paved the path for unique theoretical approaches to understand one another beyond the fixed frameworks. Fresh new methodologies are required to decipher the bilateral, including the Himalayan grievances and other specific civilizational characteristics. While conforming to Westphalian-ism, fresh thinking can contribute by crafting new epistemic dialogues, beyond existing constraints. This presentation seeks to differentiate the intractable from the retrievable and suggests the need for more clarity on the multi-spectral bilateral.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
