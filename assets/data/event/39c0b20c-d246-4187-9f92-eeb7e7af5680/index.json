Women and what was deemed as the proper transmission of their feelings were not only appropriated as figurative means to the grander end of political and social transformations; they also cohered as literal, technical mediums, as exemplary female conduits. By comparing Huang Zunxian’s technological exploits of feminine, lyrical sentimentality with Qiu Jin’s “Self-Inscription on a Photograph,” this intermediary chapter attempts to retrieve women’s relationships to technology in ways that have not been co-opted by masculine-nationalist ideologies.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
