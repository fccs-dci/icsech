The country is at once a sharp competitor to the U.S., a formidable challenger to U.S.’ regional and global leadership, and an important potential partner on a range of transnational challenges. Will it be possible for the United States to cooperate, compete, and confront China simultaneously, as some American officials have suggested? Is US-China conflict avoidable, including over Taiwan? Ryan Hass, author of Stronger: Adapting America’s China Strategy in an Age of Competitive Interdependence, will address these questions and more in opening comments before engaging in an open Q&amp;A on the future of the world’s most consequential bilateral relationship.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
