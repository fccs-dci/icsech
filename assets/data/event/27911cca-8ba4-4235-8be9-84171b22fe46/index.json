Vietnam’s ethnic Hoa communities have proactively taken advantage of their long-lasting folk religions and ritual system to reserve and further the values of maintaining ethnic cultural identity and developing inter-ethnic exchanges. With their post-war economic status in decline, Vietnam’s ethnic Chinese have been learning to use their cultural traditions to secure their position in the local society. As a result, the Confucian concept of “Without ritual, there would be no morality” (道德禮儀, 非禮不成) &nbsp;has now been re-formulated as “Without ritual, there would be no ethnic culture” (民族文化, 非禮不成) and been applied to adapt to local socio-political backgrounds in contemporary Vietnamese society.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
