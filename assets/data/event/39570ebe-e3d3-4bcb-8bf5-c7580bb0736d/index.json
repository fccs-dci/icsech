Shanghai’s New Relocation Policy provides market-based monetary compensation, including a portion of rising land values, to registered residents in the renewal area. Moreover, the New Relocation Policy constructed a set of economic incentive-oriented governance technologies and accelerated the speed of urban renewal through the technology of majority decision making. I argue that the financialization of Shanghai&#039;s relocation and resettlement system constituted the hegemonic relocation regime’s governmentality, involved the relocated households in the state-driven urbanization of capital and resulted in new forms of evictions, ethical conflicts and debt risks.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
