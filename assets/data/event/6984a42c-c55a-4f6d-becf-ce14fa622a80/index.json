So argues James Bacchus, a founding member and former chairman of the Appellate Body of the WTO. Professor Bacchus sets out his analysis in a new book, <a href=\"https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.library.nyu.edu/core/books/trade-links/F870103967A7835ADFAD7B5277EB95DF\"><em>Trade Links: New Rules for a New World</em></a>, and will share it in our webinar. He argues that the devastating global economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically illustrated the WTOâ€™s weaknesses and the need to update its rules to confront future pandemics and climate change and achieve sustainable development.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
