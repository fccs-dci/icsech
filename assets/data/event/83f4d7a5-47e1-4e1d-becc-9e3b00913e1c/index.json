Rowena He, an associate professor of history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, will reflect on the events of 2019-2022 using narrative accounts drawn from her interactions with Hong Kong and mainland Chinese students in the territory. Connecting the <em>personal</em> with the<em> social</em>, the<em> political</em>, and the<em> historical</em>, she will unpack the nuances, contradictions, and challenges posed by an unprecedented social movement and its ongoing impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>About the speaker</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rowena He </strong>is an associate professor of history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. &nbsp;Her first book, <em>Tiananmen Exiles: Voices of the Struggle for Democracy in China</em>, was named one of the top five China books of 2014 by the Asia Society’s <em>China File</em>.
