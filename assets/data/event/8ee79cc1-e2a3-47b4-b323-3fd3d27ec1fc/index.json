An unexpected consequence for local society on these small islands in the Taiwan Straits has been that virtually every local interest and issue has become entangled in some way with the larger Cross-Straits relationship. The current rise of China suggests that the same entanglement may increasingly shape politics in the rest of Taiwan, elsewhere in the region, and beyond.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
