It will firstly take stock of Africa in the BRI at a time of change and questions about the trajectory of a transcontinental nature that has been repositioning Africa’s previous salience in China’s foreign policy in the global South. Almost all African states have signed up to the BRI, which has also been integrated into the official China-Africa cooperation framework. In practice, however, the BRI remains a work in progress.&nbsp; Second, and drawing on such cases as Mali and South Sudan, it will examine the multifaceted theme of security in Africa’s engagement with the BRI and in terms of how China’s multi-level engagement has been evolving. In doing so, particular attention will be dedicated to examining China’s official rationale concerning the efficacy of economic development as key to overcoming security challenges.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
