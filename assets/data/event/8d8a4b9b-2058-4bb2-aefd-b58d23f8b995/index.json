This week, Professors Eric Feldman and Haksoo Ko talk about the stresses that COVID has posed to the constitutions and legal systems in Japan and South Korea, respectively. In Japan, the central and prefectural governments tussled over which should take emergency actions in a public health crisis. In South Korea, the government aroused privacy concerns by sharing tracing public data with the public. Discussant Neysun Mahboubi will share the insights he gleaned by organizing a special series of essays in The Regulatory Review, “Comparing Nations’ Responses to COVID-19.&quot; Mahboubi argues that the record so far “raises uncomfortable questions about governance models in the face of public health or other crises.”</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
