Since 1990, a quarter of the world’s population has risen out of extreme poverty. In 2015, 10 percent of the world’s population lived on less than $1.90 a day, down from nearly 36 percent in 1990. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts, it is likely that the poverty reduction progress will slow down or reverse in 2020. </p>\n<p>It is also important to note the changing global poverty landscape. Fighting against different forms of poverty both at home and abroad will be shared challenges faced by China and the US. Against this backdrop, we are honored to invite eight leading scholars from China and the United States to have a dialogue on how to end poverty in the changing global context.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
