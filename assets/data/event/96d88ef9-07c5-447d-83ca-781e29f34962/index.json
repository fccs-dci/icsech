In contrast to the first wave of digitised states in the West, China has adopted a far more&nbsp;<em>dirigiste&nbsp;</em>policy approach, in which the government takes a dominant role in setting objectives, mobilising resources, intervening through regulation and coordinating action.</p>\n\n<p>As such, China constitutes a “techno-developmental state”, which intends to use technology for economic and financial growth, but also for the delivery of state services in response to constantly evolving demands. Its evolution, however, does not occur in a vacuum: although the lions’ share of Beijing’s attention is devoted to domestic considerations, changing international circumstances are significantly impacting China’s access to foreign resources, technologies and markets, as well as its bid for greater influence in technical and political governance forums.</p>\n\n<p>How does the Chinese Party-State use digital technology to achieve its development goals, and how does it adapt itself in the process? This presentation will discuss the shifting circumstances that China faces, and the parameters that will shape China’s future as a leader in cutting-edge technology, as a digital economic powerhouse, and a digital society.</p>\n\n<p>I﻿N-PERSON &amp; ONLINE.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rogier Creemers</strong>&nbsp;is Assistant Professor at Leiden University.
