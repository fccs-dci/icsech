Some were circumnavigations of the globe in an era when large areas of the globe were still unknown to western explorers. This paper makes two arguments: first, that the international and multi-ethnic personal and business&nbsp;networks formed by merchants were a means of mitigating the many risks of these long-distance ventures, and that non-western actors played a central role in this; second, that maritime insurance became a key risk-reducing device developed by these&nbsp;networks to help grow this commerce in a period before the Opium Wars, when foreign trade with China remained restricted to Canton. This is the first work to examine how trading&nbsp;networks and their insurance practices in Asia enabled the riskiest of trades to be managed successfully.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
