Rather than focusing on just Japan and the USA or seeing Japan’s surrender as the definite end of the Second World War, in this lecture, Hans van de Ven examines the complex politics of surrender as various parties in China, Indonesia, and India negotiated this crucial event. He will argue that while the surrenders signified the definite end of European imperialism, it also saw the beginning of struggles for dominance of forces in each country that had grown strong and had begun to compete with each other during the Second World War in each of these three countries.</span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
