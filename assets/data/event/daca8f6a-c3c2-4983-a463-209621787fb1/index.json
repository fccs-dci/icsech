Dr. Padua’s talk will touch on: modernization and nation-building; historical notions of China’s modernity and revolutionary praxis; cultural trends “inside” and “outside” post-Mao China; and the rise of China’s secondary cities as living laboratories for design innovation, legacy-building and political ambitions. Dr. Padua’s talk will focus on ways the four purpose-built public parks represent the schema for post-Mao China’s hybrid modern design genre. Dr. Padua will also speculate on the shift from China’s late 20th century “hybrid modernization” and Deng’s “growth first” unregulated development to China’s 21st century “ecological modernization.&quot;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
