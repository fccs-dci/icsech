In Western scholarship, such multiethnic literary voices have remained largely silent and understudied. Drawing from her first book manuscript, in this talk, Dr. Zhang will offer a critical and timely introduction to Chinese ethnic minority literature from a global perspective. Particularly, she will demonstrate how literature produced by ethnic groups of southwest China seeks to forge a &quot;transnational tribal solidarity:&quot; minority poets articulate their connections to Native American cultures and Latin American literary influences.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
