For several years, critics of China in the West have noted its rising influence in multilateral organizations ranging from obscure specialized agencies that set technical standards to organizations tasked with implementing the major international human rights treaties. Mark Lambert, the new special envoy for U.N. integrity, will talk about his mandate, how the United States hopes to reverse its declining international influence, and challenges faced by the global governance structures put in place after World War II when the United States had a different vision of its role in the world.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
