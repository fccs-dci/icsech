CEAS Author Talks series, this event features California College of the Arts Professor, Mia Yinxing Liu, and her book, &quot;Literati Lenses: Wenren Landscape in Chinese Cinema of the Mao Era,&quot; Since its birth, Chinese cinema has been exploring the ways to engage with China’s art<br />\ntraditions, and these engagements can range from violently iconoclastic to devotedly reverential. This book focuses on the “problematic” or even “poisonous” films, words used in official criticism from the Party’s media, and demonstrates that in these films lies the lineage between cinema and the aesthetics of traditional landscape art. This program also features University of Chicago&#039;s Paola Iovene as Discussant.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
