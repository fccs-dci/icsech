In this lecture Dr. Burton-Rose focuses on Presenting Oneself to the Spirits (Zhishen lu, preface 1773), Shaosheng’s compilation of the divine communications of the previous four generations of his male relatives. In Presenting Oneself, Shaosheng developed the theological justifications for spirit-writing practice formulated by his great-grandfather Peng Dingqiu (1645–1719) into a method for reuniting Heaven and Man. He thereby claimed a place for his own patriline in a chain of divine revelations from the high deity Wenchang that first began in the Song dynasty (960–1279).</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
