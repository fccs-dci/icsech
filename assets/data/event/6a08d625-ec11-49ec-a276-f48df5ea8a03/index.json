The various gaps in information regarding the origin and spread of the virus have led to an image problem for China. While news reportage from China creates a simulacrum of a responsible and cooperative &#039;self&#039;, in contrast, western media coverage continues to unravel ambiguities in China&#039;s claims, pitching China as the &#039;other&#039; in world politics. This paper analyses news coverage in two western dailies and two Chinese dailies (in English) - The New York Times, The Guardian, People&#039;s Daily and The Global Times - regarding the virus&#039;s origin since the Pandemic outbreak in January 2020 and investigates the framing and agenda-setting to compare and contrast China&#039;s image construction on either side. It builds on the tradition of studying images in international relations by positing perceived and associated images constructed in this case.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
