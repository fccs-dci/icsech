But the country also ranks 105th in a global gender equality survey, has had the largest gender pay gap in the OECD for decades, and is ranked as the worst place for a working woman in the industrialized world. However, Korean women are increasingly trying to change that, by building a robust #MeToo campaign, ushering in a powerful wave of feminist movement through the late 2010s and early 2020s. Hawon Jung, a former Seoul correspondent for AFP, has extensively covered the issues of sexual discrimination and violence, and her book,&nbsp;<em>Flowers of Fire</em>, chronicles the recent women’s rights activism that has ushered in many social, political, cultural changes in the country for the past decade. The seminar will examine and elucidate all these issues and the challenges faced by women in South Korea.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
