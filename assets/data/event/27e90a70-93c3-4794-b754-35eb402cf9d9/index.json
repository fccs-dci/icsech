The book is intended to introduce the topic to ordinary people who are interested in India-China relations and foreign policy issues. Shri Gokhale will be speaking about the broad factors that shaped China&#039;s approach to negotiations, the different approaches that India and China took on negotiations and the manner in which the perceptions that each has about the other has shaped the approach to negotiations. The seminar is intended to simplify the understanding of Chinese negotiating strategy and tactics.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
