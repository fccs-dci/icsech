CHMap provides large-scale, geo-referenced land survey maps of China produced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as base layers via Web Map Tile Service. It allows researchers to integrate image collections from other sources on top of those base layers for exploratory and comparative analyses.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
