Human Rights Now, a Tokyo-based international human rights NGO, works to promote awareness and implementation of the principles in Asia. It puts particular emphasis on the role of Japanese companies in investment and supply chains. Human Rights Now has investigated and campaigned against exploitative working conditions at Uniqlo factories in China, Japanese companies’ business connections with the Myanmar military, and child labor in Myanmar’s fishing industry, among other issues. Human Rights Now founder Kazuko Ito, a Japanese attorney (and former NYU visiting scholar), will discuss the organization’s activities and strategies in conversation with NYU Law Adjunct Professor Bruce Aronson.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
