Too often, political obstacles prevent developing states&nbsp;from&nbsp;adopting strong formal institutions. In this book, Lizhi Liu proposes that China has devised a novel solution&nbsp;to&nbsp;this political problem: institutional outsourcing. Liu argues that, with weak rule of law, the state has outsourced part of its institutional functions&nbsp;to&nbsp;key private actors, which she calls, private regulatory intermediaries (PRIs). Using as the context China’s e-commerce market, where 800 million active users generate more than 100 million transactions per day, Liu shows that online trading platforms (e.g., Alibaba’s Taobao.com and Tmall.com) have begun&nbsp;to&nbsp;serve as PRIs. More specifically, platforms privately supply market-supporting institutions&nbsp;to&nbsp;enforce contracts, prevent fraud, and settle disputes. In addition&nbsp;to&nbsp;legal functions, the state has effectively off-loaded a part of social and political functions&nbsp;to&nbsp;platforms. Not only do platforms enforce rules, they also assist the state in creating and reforming formal institutions through institutional experiments. Liu demonstrates that institutional outsourcing, as an alternative route&nbsp;to&nbsp;institutional development, is a more politically viable solution&nbsp;to&nbsp;market failure and governance deficit than the direct reforming of formal institutions. She further shows in the book&nbsp;that, China's e-commerce&nbsp;boom&nbsp;carries profound effects on state-business relations, household welfare, and the stability of the authoritarian regime in general.</p>\n\n<p>This book project employs&nbsp;a mixed methods approach and draws on a variety of original or proprietary data. Qualitatively, Liu has conducted over 200 interviews during 14 months of fieldwork, supplemented by nine years of online ethnographic research. Quantitatively, she analyzes original datasets that include the web-scraped information of 1.76 million online stores, an original national survey, and a longitudinal survey on 2,800 households conducted with a large-scale field experiment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lizhi Liu is an assistant professor at the McDonough School of Business and a faculty affiliate of the Department of Government at Georgetown University.
