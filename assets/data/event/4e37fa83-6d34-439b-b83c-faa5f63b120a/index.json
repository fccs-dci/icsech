It further advocated equal political rights for women through various strategic measures such as laws and policies that would ensure equal access to economic resources and participation in the economic construction in family and society, including “equal sharing of housework” and family responsibilities such as care work. The question is: Does gender equality and women empowerment figure in the soft power tools that were – and are - used to influence the world about the “good China story”? The talk would present an analysis of China’s soft power engagement with the global south, with an attempt to explore the policies and practices of gender equality and women’s empowerment. After an initial discursive view on the distinctive characteristics of China’s soft power, it would underline the major instrumentalities in its global south engagement, drawing examples from South Asia. The author argues that the question of gender equality and women’s empowerment have been missing throughout the development of soft power mechanisms or instrumentalities. Although, in multilateral platforms such as the United Nations and world conferences as well as in domestic state planning, some policy attention was given to the question of gender equality and women empowerment, these policy pronouncements have largely remained as statements of policy intentions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
