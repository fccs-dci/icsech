The United States is a federal system, and state governments have played a well-known prominent role in the formation of the national constitution. The development history of the U.S. constitution has been full of back-and-forth between the federal government and the states. In contrast, China is often seen as a highly centralized unitary state, but local governments actually have extensive legislative powers, including a key transition that occurred during the late Qing and early Republican periods when provincial governments across China developed local constitutional systems, framing the basic framework for local institutions in the later national constitution. In-depth understanding of the role of regional governments in the development of national constitutions can not only help us better recognize the complexity and dynamism of constitutional construction, but also provide insights into the possible choices we face today.</p>\n\n<p>Speaker:<br />\nBin Ling, Professor at Peking University Law School, and PhD Supervisor.
