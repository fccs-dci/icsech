And at the same time, they remain patriotic, and supporters of the Communist Party of China. This issue has also featured extensively, directly and indirectly, in Chinese social media. Hemant Adlakha and Kishan S Rana wrote an article on this subject, which was published in&nbsp;<em>The Indian Express</em>&nbsp;on 7th June, 2023. In this seminar, they examine different facets of this issue, which connect, among others, with demographic trends, the state of the economy, the rural-urban divide, and societal trends. They will also offer some comparisons with youth trends in India.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
