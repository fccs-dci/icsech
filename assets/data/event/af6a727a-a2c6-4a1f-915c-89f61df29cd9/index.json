At the same time, however, surviving texts from this period also evince attitudes no less xenophobic than those found in texts from the ninth through eleventh centuries, when scholars have often claimed that China became less open to ethnocultural others. This talk will argue that what changes between these periods are not, in fact, contemporary attitudes towards “the barbarians,” who were almost universally reviled in surviving texts from throughout the Tang. Instead, changing ideas about texts themselves, and about the ways that texts should ideally operate within the world, produced a transformation in how longstanding and relatively unchanging tropes about ethnocultural others were understood and deployed. The apparent decline of elite “cosmopolitan” attitudes from the seventh century to the tenth thus reflects, in significant part, a shift in literary theory.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
