Specifically, through the case study of Ethiopia, the presentation demonstrates that Chinaâ€™s fusion of practical or tangible benefits with language and cultural promotion invokes support from key participants, including university administrators, students, and Chinese teachers. At the same time, the apparent gaps between rising expectations of Ethiopian administrators and students and the limited resources on the ground, present a challenge for sustainability of CIs in Ethiopia and beyond.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
