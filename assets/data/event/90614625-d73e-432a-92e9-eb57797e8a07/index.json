Over the last seven years I have been closely reading the&nbsp;<em><em>Shiji zhiyi</em></em>&nbsp;and have produced a book-length study that focuses on Liang’s comments on the&nbsp;<em><em>Shiji&nbsp;</em></em>passages that relate to the slow rise and precipitous fall of Qin, the first empire, and that weaves Liang’s scholarship into a revision of Sima Qian’s narration of the transformation of Qin from marginal state to hegemonic power. The book—published by Berkeley’s Institute of East Asian Studies in October 2023—provides an account of Liang’s life<em><em>&nbsp;</em></em>and methodology before turning to revisions of what the&nbsp;<em><em>Shiji&nbsp;</em></em>says about Qin’s origins, the state’s ruling lineage, and its later kings and emperors, as well as the geography of the Qin state and empire, and the numerous battles from which Qin emerged as ultimate victor in 221 BCE. The foundation of these revisions is the&nbsp;<em><em>Shiji zhiyi</em></em>. But on occasion I supplement and correct Liang’s scholarship by referring to the numerous archaeological discoveries that have dramatically altered our understanding of what happened in the history of early China. In my presentation I provide the examples of Liang’s methodology and the more dramatic revisions his scholarship suggests. My point is that, while there are imperfections in Liang’s work and points where his revisions are outdated, ill-founded, or incomplete, the translations and studies that ignore them or otherwise render, interpret, and adopt the&nbsp;<em><em>Shiji&nbsp;</em></em>“as is” are at best misguided.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speaker</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Jeffrey Riegel</strong></strong><br />\nProfessor Emeritus<br />\nThe University of California, Berkeley, and The University of Sydney</p>\n\n<p>Jeffrey Riegel is retired from professorial positions at the University of California, Berkeley (1979-2007), and The University of Sydney (2007-2017). Jeff has published widely on early Chinese thought, literature, and archaeology. He has been a visiting professor at Cambridge University, Fudan University, Renmin University, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and still occasionally gives talks in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Australia, and North America. His publications include&nbsp;<em><em>The Annals of Lü Buwei</em></em>&nbsp;(Stanford, 2000) and&nbsp;<em><em>Mozi: A Study and Translation of the Ethical and Political Writings</em></em>&nbsp;(Berkeley: Institute of East Asian Studies, 2013). Jeff’s recently-completed book-length study of eighteenth-century Chinese historiography on the rise of the Qin empire—entitled&nbsp;<em><em>A Journal of My Misgivings</em></em>—was published by Berkeley’s IEAS in October 2023. His articles appear in major sinological journals. A selection of them has been translated into Chinese and collected into a volume entitled&nbsp;<em><em>Wang Anguo Hanxue lunwenji&nbsp;</em></em>王安國漢學論文集 forthcoming in 2024 from the Zhonghua shuju in China. Jeff spends most of his time at his homes in Siem Reap and Palm Springs.</p>\n\n<p>Click&nbsp;<a data-msys-clicktrack=\"0\" href=\"https://ieas.directfrompublisher.com/catalog/book/journal-my-misgivings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ieas.directfrompublisher.com/catalog/book/journal-my-misgivings\">here&nbsp;</a>to find out more about the publication.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
