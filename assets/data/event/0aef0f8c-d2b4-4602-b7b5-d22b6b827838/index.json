Earlier in mid-October and early-November, President Xi was confirmed to a norm-bending third term in office while President Biden emerged more-or-less politically unscathed from a bruising mid-term election.</p>\n\n<p>At a time when U.S.-China relations continue to tread water, what are the key takeaways of the 20th Party Congress and the Midterm Elections for bilateral ties in 2023? In Bali, did Presidents Biden and Xi manage to set a ‘floor’ beneath their relationship and stabilize ties? Did they achieve the 3Rs — re–establish a baseline of communications; restart dialogue channels; reassure the other of their strategic intentions? How does the centralization of power in President Xi impact the politics of cross-strait relations as well as the timeline of a potential Taiwan Strait conflict? Will the slim but emboldened Republican majority in the House have an impact on the U.S.’ Taiwan policy in 2023-24? To listen to these and other answers to pressing U.S.-China questions, tune in to the event on November 30th.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
