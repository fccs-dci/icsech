With more and more tech companies moving operations to the Heartland region, so comes an influx of remote workers inland from coastal cities. The trend of this burgeoning tech industry outside of Silicon Valley and increase of megatech companies and startups is derived from a trust in the Midwest and increased global investment in the inland region. How does the Heartland capitalize on this nationwide transition inward? What does this mean for Heartland residents and what economic and innovation policies can we expect?<br />\n<br />\nJoin USHCA for our second event in our Authors Series this year, as we invite Rebecca A.
