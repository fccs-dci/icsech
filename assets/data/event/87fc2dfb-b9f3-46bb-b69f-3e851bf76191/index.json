How and why do state–market relations differ? And do these differences matter in the post-cold war era of global conflict and cooperation? Drawing on research in China, India, and Russia and examining sectors from textiles to telecommunications, Micro-institutional Foundations of Capitalism introduces a new theory of sectoral pathways to globalization and development. Roselyn Hsueh is an associate professor of political science at Temple University, where she co-directs the Certificate in Political Economy. She is the author of \"Micro-Institutional Foundations of Capitalism: Sectoral Pathways to Globalization in China, India, and Russia\" (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming, 2022) and \"China’s Regulatory State: A New Strategy for Globalization\" (Cornell University Press, 2011).</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
