These ‘miracles’ were the dazzling wonders produced by religious objects as well as highly attained Buddhist practitioners. In China, many embraced the wonder-working abilities of both Chinese monks and foreign missionaries. This was, in part, because the marvels associated to Buddhist practitioners and objects fell in line with indigenous understandings of the miraculous as attested to in the medical, philosophical, historiographical, and divinatory traditions of China. Miraculous occurrences and supernormal powers were, for missionaries on the ground as well as for individuals recording these events, used to prove the efficacy of the new Buddhist creed in China. These miracles were often recorded in collections of biographies, apologia, and miracle tales.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
