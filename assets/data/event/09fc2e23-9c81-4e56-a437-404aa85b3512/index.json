With the focus on the scroll’s authenticity, there was renewed interest and disagreement regarding the scroll’s seals. In this lecture, it will be demonstrated that further examination of the seals leads to a rare opportunity to reconstruct not only the later history of this famous scroll containing Su’s and Mi’s “twin treasures,” but rare insight into the scroll’s making and reception.<o:p></o:p></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
