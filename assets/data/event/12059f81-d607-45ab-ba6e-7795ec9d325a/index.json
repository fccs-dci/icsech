She should stay at home, dress modestly, and be a good wife. Chinese silent films of the 1920s and early 1930s often convey ideological messages strikingly at odds with May Fourth ideals such as equality of the sexes and liberation of the individual. While some films express sympathy for progressive causes and outrage at present inequalities, others are overtly misogynistic and reactionary. This talk will focus on Chinese-made films that May Fourth figures would consider to be on the wrong side of history, and show how they harness the power of the film medium—charismatic stars, special effects, popular Hollywood tropes—to take us back to the good old days. On this May Fourth anniversary, bring your sense of righteousness and film studies sensibilities to this tour through moral dramas such as&nbsp;<em>The Pearl Necklace</em>&nbsp;一串珍珠 (1926),&nbsp;<em>Don’t Change Your Husband</em>&nbsp;情海重吻 (1929),&nbsp;<em>Poor Daddy</em>&nbsp;怕老婆 (1929),&nbsp;<em>Love and Duty</em>&nbsp;戀愛與義務 (1931), and&nbsp;<em>The Peach Girl</em>&nbsp;桃花泣血記 (1931). #<em>NoraStayHome</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Christopher Rea</strong>&nbsp;is Professor of Chinese and former Director of the Centre for Chinese Research at the University of British Columbia.
