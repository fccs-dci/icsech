The number of people who live alone is also on the rise, especially in cosmopolitan cities and coastal areas. This rising single population gave rise to an emerging ‘singles economy’ (danshen jingji), marked by growing demand for mini-apartments for solo dwellers, appliances for one-person households, food delivery services tailored to ‘singletons’, tour packages for single men and women, companion pets, and boyfriend and girlfriend-renting services.</p>\n\n<p>I will unpack China’s growing ‘singles economy’ through a case study of the date-renting industry, which has become a thriving part of the Chinese economy. Through analysis of various date-renting websites and drawing on the theories that focused on the intersection of romance/emotions and the market/capitalism, I identify the logic of the date-renting industry and the gendered strategic presentation of ‘date-traders’ online. I argue that the boundary between emotions and capitalism has become increasingly blurred as these two seemingly opposing forces are converging, constituting a unique phenomenon in China’s singles economy. This manifests as an economically moulded dating culture intertwined with new, intricate social and personal relations – a by-product of China’s demographic shifts and rapidly growing market economy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pan Wang</strong>&nbsp;is Senior Lecturer in Chinese and Asian Studies, University of New South Wales, Sydney.
