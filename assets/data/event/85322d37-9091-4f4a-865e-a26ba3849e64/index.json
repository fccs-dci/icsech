In authoritarian societies such as the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, as well as in China, where the scope for social and political activism is extremely limited, literature has often served as an ideal tool for expressing concerns of the common people. This presentation will explore the literary activism (文学行动主义,&nbsp;<em>wénxué xíngdòng zhǔyì</em>) of two Chinese writers in the post-Mao period, namely Wang Anyi and Wang Shuo, mainly in two areas, i.e., ‘class’ and ‘gender’. The speaker would also take an overview of their works through the 1980s and 1990s to look for other concerns, such as traditions, social morality and parental authority.&nbsp; These new literary trends signal towards a broadening space of creativity/activism and both writers have explored new concerns within their respective dominant trends, sometimes even with changing parameters. The space and concerns of literary creativity and activism are much more fragmented in nature in the 1980s and 1990s, than in the Mao’s period. Their works highlight the multiplicity of spaces from which Wang Anyi and Wang Shuo are engaging with complex issues of the contemporary Chinese society.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
