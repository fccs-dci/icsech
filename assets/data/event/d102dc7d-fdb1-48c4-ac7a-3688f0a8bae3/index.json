The world suffered an intellectual loss when democracy was turned into the equivalent of multiparty elections, while socialism was defined by the Eastern bloc strictly in the Marxist-Leninist framework to mean a political system with a single ruling communist/worker’s party. Both democracy and socialism contain much more expansive meanings to enlighten our understanding of political diversities around the world. While democracy should be broadened to encompass the norms and beliefs and the accompanying institutional structures to ensure that the government serves the people’s interests, socialism should be taken to mean the various policy positions that prioritize social equality and equity, among others. China represents an apposite case in our efforts to bring sufficient width into the substantive understanding of these two concepts.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
