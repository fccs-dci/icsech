He foresaw that a) the PRC will further its effort to “mainlandise” Taiwan to ultimately annex the island nation; b) no country alone by itself could deter China’s quest for hegemony; c) India will continue to grow both demographically and economically; and d) no attempt to build a coalition of like minded countries over the Indo Pacific maritime domain will be substantive without fully engaging India. The new geo-political concept of “Indo-Pacific” thus was born under his resolved leadership, and the QUAD security arrangement also took shape as a result. The speaker will look back at what he sought to achieve for what purposes and argue that now, with Abe having passed, Japan’s diplomacy will likely go in a zigzag, while its foundation is more solid than in the pre-Abe era. Tokyo will soon start the budgeting process for the next fiscal year. By December it will revise some of the defence related policy doctrines. The speaker will also address those developments.</span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
