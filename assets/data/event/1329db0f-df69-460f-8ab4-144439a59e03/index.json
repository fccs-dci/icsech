After the nuclear accident and reactor shutdowns, the deficit in electric power was met by a reliance on fossil fuels. Since then, a higher share of renewables has reduced the carbon intensity of the power sector in general. By signing the 2015 UNFCCC Paris Agreement, the twin challenges of reducing its fossil fuel intensity and ensuring stability to its energy supply priorities became even more profound. An analysis of the four triennial, “Strategic Energy Plans” since the disaster, and the latest interim adjustment, reveals these uncertainties, especially since the supply disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The excessive reliance on fossil fuels, “carbon neutrality” commitments, the even higher target to raise the share of renewables, the restarts of reactors, liberalisation of the domestic electricity market, etc., all brought in their share of uncertainties. This seminar will explore Japan’s decision to “restart and rebuild” its reactor fleet, the factors which necessitated these changes and the challenges ahead in keeping up with the commitments, both domestic and the international.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
