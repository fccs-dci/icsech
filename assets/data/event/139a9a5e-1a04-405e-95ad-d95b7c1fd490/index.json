As the exceptionally high rate of Chinese takeout restaurants forced to close in 2020 indicates, the pandemic has reinforced a long-held racist view of Chinese food as unhealthy and unhygienic. This panel addresses how we can help to solve this problem by incorporating cooking and eating as a critical teaching component in Asian and Asian-American history classes. More specifically, it will ask what kinds of teaching methods we can experiment with when approaching food (arguably one of the most engaging themes) as an historical subject. It will also explore how we can encourage students to ask critical questions regarding Chinese food in terms of its consumption and production in order for them to appreciate the unlikely interplay of food and racial politics. Finally, it will address how the hands-on experience of cooking, which includes grocery shopping and recipe research as well as eating and sharing, can serve as a powerful teaching tool for promoting such values as diversity, inclusion, and respect in a pandemic era. Two speakers will present on their experience of teaching on this theme, which will be followed by a discussion with the audience.</p>\n\n<p>This event will take place as part of WEAI’s ongoing series, “Asia in Action: Knowledge and Inclusion in a Time of Fear and Ignorance.”</p>\n\n<p>(Rescheduled from Fall 2021)</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
