This talk places the contemporary focus on the health benefits of mindfulness within the history of Buddhist engagements with medicine, with particular attention to China. It outlines the many rich and complex approaches to healing that have been (and still are in many cases) used in Chinese Buddhist communities, both in order to learn more about Chinese culture and also to suggest directions for further historical and clinical research beyond mindfulness.</span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
