The Nilgiris have gained the distinction of being a geographic indication for tea, today. Somewhere behind the present glory is a remote connection with the Chinese that remains forgotten. Travelling across three countries and reams of colonial office records, “Those 4 Years” is an amazing journey into the lives of those Chinese who came to India around the middle of the 19th century. It is a history of people, plants and places - as it catalogues their contributions to plantations, locates places and sites associated with their earliest arrival and stay and, more remarkably, manages to locate some of the descendants of those Chinese who arrived in India over 150 years ago.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
