As an ardent nationalist with a whip of leadership, however, his advocacy of political agenda often challenged and split the public opinion such as revision of the Japanese Constitution and revision of national security legislation, along with uncompromising leadership on the issues of history and island disputes to the neighboring countries. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"background-image:initial\"><span style=\"background-position:initial\"><span style=\"background-size:initial\"><span style=\"background-repeat:initial\"><span style=\"background-origin:initial\"><span style=\"background-clip:initial\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"DE-AT\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">He sought to make Japan a \"normal nation\" that could secure its national interests in the face of a rising and assertive China and a relatively declining and uncertain United States. His greatest successes in this regard lie in keenly understanding the domestic politics of partner countries and developing bilateral and multilateral forms of security and economic cooperation across the Indo-Pacific. He was, however, less successful in managing relations with Korea and overcoming traditional obstacles to Japan's defence, commerce and exports.&nbsp;Abe's policies will have long-lasting effects on Japan's national security, and are likely to be continued by his successors in some form. External pressures will certainly shape much of this trajectory, with Japan walking the line between keeping Beijing at bay and Washington invested in East Asia. </span></span></span></span><span lang=\"DE-AT\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">This seminar will discuss Shinzo Abeâ€™s legacy in domestic, foreign and security policy and how sustainable it will be post his demise.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
