Professor Bing Bing Jia, one of China’s leading international law scholars, takes a more optimistic view.&nbsp; He argues that the UN continues to show its unique and irreplaceable strengths as a forum for diplomacy and for breaking political stalemates through application of international law.&nbsp; In conversation with USALI Faculty Director José E. Alvarez, Jia will discuss how, in his view, the UN is able to represent the international community and deal with challenges to international law more effectively than smaller groupings such as the G-20 or European Union.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
