His remarks will be divided into three parts: 1) Unprecedented transformation of China since 1979; 2) China’s role in the world via its gradual integration into the current global system; and 3) China’s participation in global governance, especially its effort to engage with international institutions by proposing new agendas to the international community. </span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-indent:.5in\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"layout-grid-mode:char\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,serif\">In a context in which globalization has been retreating for years, China’s contribution to globalization is always underestimated, given that populism and unilateralism are prevailing in many countries. Sometimes China is accused of taking advantage of other countries. We must therefore seek insight to find a proper interpretation of China’s rise. </span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-indent:.5in\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"layout-grid-mode:char\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,serif\">In addition, reassessing China’s dramatic rise and its interaction with the world may inspire us to address current global problems in a balanced fashion, rather than simply blaming China as a scapegoat. Instead of probing the external environment that has accommodated China’s rapid growth, the speaker will take a unique perspective by emphasizing the impact of China’s internal momentum on its rise.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,serif\">Moderator: <b>Wei Victor Huang, </b>Chair and Professor of Finance, UHM College of Business.
