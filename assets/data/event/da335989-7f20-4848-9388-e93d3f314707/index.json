As Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt-and-Road initiative continues to expand China’ global reach, pushback has resulted from the spread of Covid-19 and African governments’ increasing debt to the Chinese government. These developments raise new geopolitical questions now that other parts of the world and China are “decoupling.” State actors continue to occupy analytical mindsets.</p>\n\n<p>Siu complicates the land-based, state-centered conceptual frameworks by highlighting the historical legacies and contemporary fluidities that make up the life worlds of multi-ethnic stakeholders who have long traversed the continental divides. Based on ethnographic trips in Tanzania, the Gulf Region, South and Southeast Asia, Guangdong and Hong Kong, Siu uncovers crucial layers of maritime connections and explores how diverse human encounters, their nuanced cultural meanings and intense powerplay are expressed.</p>\n\n<p>S﻿peaker's Bio:</p>\n\n<p>Helen F.
