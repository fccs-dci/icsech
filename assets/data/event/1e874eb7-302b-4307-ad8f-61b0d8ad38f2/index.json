Over two decades, both the historic urban Shanghai and its newly built contrasting city centre have turned into a manifestation of the “China Dream” with a built environment closely resembling other global cities. The transformed city has also experienced influx of millions of internal migrants, and state language policies mandating the usage of the national language instead of the vernacular in all spheres of public life. Developmental policies of China’s economic reform era produced a new urban middle class which is more education-level and income based, than birthplace or political-affiliation based, as in the Maoist era. Situated at the intersection of phenomenological concepts of place and non-place, individuals’ place-bound identity, and tropes of language ideology, based on field research in 2013 and 2017, this research focuses on how these Chinese urbanites internalize and navigate the transformed urban geographical and sociolinguistic landscape and position themselves in it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
