Korean relations regarding the N. Korean nuclear threat. In particular, it explores how security cooperation between Japan &amp; S. Korea differed following the 3rd &amp; 4th (as well as 5th &amp; 6th) N. Korean nuclear tests. In contrast to existing explanations, this lecture focuses on the convergence &amp; divergence of strategic priorities between both countries, apart from external threat perception. It argues that the credibility of U.S.&#039; commitment to protect its allies from the increasing North Korean nuclear threat is a constant &amp; hence not a defining factor in Japan-ROK relations. Finally, cooperation &amp; conflict over historical issues influence security relations between both countries but are not constant. This lecture argues that convergent/divergent interactions in strategic priorities, and the degree of discord and cooperation in historical issues between the two nations determine the levels of security cooperation between Japan &amp; S. Korea.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
