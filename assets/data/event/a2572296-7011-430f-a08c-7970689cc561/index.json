Especially since the war in Ukraine, the EU and the United States have moved closer on tougher policies towards Beijing. China’s purported position of neutrality is being seen as tacit support of Russia and the joint statement inked by Putin and Xi which contained a joint critique of NATO raised many eyebrows. There can now be seen a newfound sense of leadership in Brussels after using its economic muscles through sanctions and the provision of military aid to Ukraine. Moving away from classical diplomatic language, the EU is taking a tougher stance on China even as the considerable economic and trade relations continue. In this context, this seminar will examine the evolving EU-China relations and the impact of the Ukraine crisis on redefining the transatlantic stance on China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
