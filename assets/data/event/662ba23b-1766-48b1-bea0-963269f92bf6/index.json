It will focus on the issue of reincarnation of tulkus or rinpoches, who are hierarchs in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. This tradition is turning into a major site of contestation between the Tibetans and the party state. When the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) marched into Tibet, they encountered a unique socio-political system, that is defined as a theocracy by many. As a belief system, Buddhism has a hegemonic hold over the Tibetans. Moreover, Tibetan Buddhism influences people in the Himalayan belt, a space contested by postcolonial India and China. It emerges as a factor in Sino-Indian relations, which will be highlighted during the presentation. However, the focus will be on the different modes of interaction between the Tibetan Buddhist elites and the CCP. While a greater part of this contact between them is described as conflict, the presentation will highlight moments of cooperation and co-option. The process will be understood through the idea of ‘binding the deities’, which was an important mode of ‘Buddhicisation’ of Tibet and the Himalayas.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
