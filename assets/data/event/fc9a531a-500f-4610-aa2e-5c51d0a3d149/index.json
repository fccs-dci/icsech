In 2012, it was estimated that more than 100,000 Africans lived in the southern city of Guangzhou, China. Nevertheless, Black communities in China have long reported inconsistent immigration law enforcement and racial profiling, an issue that has come under the spotlight since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Recent months saw increased reports of random passport inspections, incidents of housing discrimination, and arbitrary detainment. In response, the Chinese government claims to be addressing illegal entry of foreigners and “imported” cases of Covid-19. Such incidents have drawn the attention of commentators across the globe to the treatment of African migrant workers by law enforcement. This panel will explore how China’s work visa policies impact African workers currently in or hoping to enter China in today&#039;s context.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
