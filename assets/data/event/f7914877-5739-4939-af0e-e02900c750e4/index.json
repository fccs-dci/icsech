He will also delve into how this process amplified conflict between those business, civil society, and state actors that had a differing interest in sustaining a PRC-oriented tourist industry, creating an increasingly pluralistic civic nationalism in Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ian Rowen&nbsp;</strong>is Associate Professor in the Department of Taiwan Culture, Languages and Literature at National Taiwan Normal University. Previously an assistant professor of Geography and Sociology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he earned his PhD in Geography from the University of Colorado at Boulder.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This event was made possible by the generous support of the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
