Attendance via Zoom is available.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Harassment and violence directed at Asians and Asian-Americans has surged since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jennifer Wu (NYU Law 2004) and Lawrence Wee, partners at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP, have stepped up to provide pro bono legal representation for victims of Asian hate crimes, including some of the most vicious recent attacks. Victims they have represented include Yao Pan Ma, Gui Yi Ma, and Michelle Go. Wu, a patent litigator, and Wee, a capital markets specialist, will talk about the challenges of litigating hate crimes and the relationship of Asian-American immigrant communities to the legal system. They also will share their own experiences as Asian-American lawyers and advice on balancing pro bono work with their commercial practices. This event is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/belonging\">Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging.</a></p>\n\n<p>Relevant links:</p>\n\n<ul data-rte-list=\"default\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.paulweiss.com/media/3982066/why-paul-weiss-is-the-pro-bono-go-to-for-victims-of-asian-hate.pdf\">Why Paul Weiss Is the Pro-bono Go-To for Victims of Asian Hate</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.easternstandardtimes.com/episode/asian-hate-crimes-what-is-justice\">Asian Hate Crimes: What Is Justice</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.onbar.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Endless_Tide_Report_2022_FIN.pdf\">Endless Tide: The Continuing Struggle to Overcome Anti-Asian Hate in New York</a></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1663945738314_253\"><em>About the speakers</em></h3>\n\n<p>Jennifer H.
