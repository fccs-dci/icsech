Combining open access and crowd collaboration, it enables search, keyword tagging, statistical analysis, text comparison, etc. for over 47,000 Chinese digital texts (~7.6 billion words) from Academia Sinica, Kyoto University, and more. The English version of the platform was added in 2020, allowing big data analysis of English texts. In the October webinar of the East Asian Digital Scholarship series, Dr. Wang Hsiang-an will introduce the platform to us.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
