With a geopolitically central location, the country’s domestic and international policies are poised to change the face of global affairs. The Belt and Road Initiative has called attention to a deepening Eurasian continentalism that has, argues Kent Calder, much more significant implications than have yet been recognized. In Super Continent, Calder presents a theoretically guided and empirically grounded explanation for these changes. He shows that key inflection points, beginning with the Four Modernizations and the collapse of the Soviet Union; and culminating in China’s response to the Global Financial Crisis and Crimea’s annexation, are triggering tectonic shifts.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
