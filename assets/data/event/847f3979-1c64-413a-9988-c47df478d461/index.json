Its integral role makes it not only a pillar of national security but also a barometer of a nation&#039;s technological advancement. India is amongst several countries that are grappling with the dilemma of balancing cost &amp; security when it comes to deployment of telecom networks. China&#039;s dominant position in the telecom sector &amp; weak privacy laws have turbo-charged its capabilities into a potent weapon against other countries. China has also made Huawei&#039;s acceptability, a policy objective of its foreign policy. The Webinar will combine different perspectives from domains of policy, industry, and technology to deliver clarity on various questions such as: Nature and extent of India&#039;s dependency on China? How did this come about? What risks does it entail? How can India reduce dependency? How does India ensure such dependency on China does not repeat in other sectors?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
