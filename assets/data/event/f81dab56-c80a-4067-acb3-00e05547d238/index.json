Existing scholarship argues that media representation of women’s political life reflects existing gender norms of ‘public man, private women’, and largely sees the relationship between media, gender and political leadership as static.</p>\n\n<p>The representation of early generations of female Chinese leaders confirms this view. This is illustrated by the cases of Jiang Qing and Ye Qun’s political roles being portrayed as mere mistakes, and the cases of Deng Yingchao’s public roles being seen as an extension of her domestic roles and extensive media attention being paid to Wu Yi’s private life. Since the last decade, however, there has been little difference between media representation of female and male politicians.</p>\n\n<p>The authors argues that media representation of female politicians is a changing dynamic. In an authoritarian system, the changes can be caused by the varying needs of the dominant political party at different times. In the case of China, these are the needs of dealing with legitimacy crises, presenting a positive image to the outside world, and strengthening its centralized rule.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speakers</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Minglu Chen&nbsp;</strong></strong>is a senior lecturer in the Discipline of Government and International Relations and director of the Local China Project at the University of Sydney China Studies Centre.
