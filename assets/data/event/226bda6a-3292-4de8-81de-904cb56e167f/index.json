Unipolarity, bipolarity, or multipolarity? This talk examines the theoretical and real-world challenges of deciphering the polarity of the international system. It argues that the root cause of the challenges lies with the fuzzy nature of power, which makes precise measurement of state power and comparisons of state power difficult at best. This is especially the case during a power transition, which creates fluid and unpredictable power trends. For example, whether a rising China has “peaked” or a relatively declining United States has successfully retrenched have implications for forecasting the emerging polarity. This talk examines the current debate over polarity and how it affects our understanding of US-China relations. It is premised on structural realism’s insight on the centrality of polarity in explaining great power behaviors and international outcomes.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
