We probe into the case of China, the largest authoritarian donor in the world, and contend that the regime survival imperative drives China&#039;s aid policies to prioritize commercial interests and sustain the state capitalism model. By leveraging multiple data sources, we empirically document that Chinese aid projects lead to a substantial surge of Chinese exports to aid recipient countries. Perhaps more importantly, we find the aid-induced trade benefits primarily state-owned enterprises (SOEs), particularly ones that are under-performing, less productive, labor-intensive, and crippled with heavy debt burdens. The findings have important implications for understanding China&#039;s economic engagement in the world.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
