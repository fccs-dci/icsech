Yet, a comparative analysis of the historical trajectories of medieval Europe and imperial China raises puzzles that cannot be readily solved by the existing framework. Why was Europe, with stronger rule of law and property rights, mired in conflict during most of its history, while China experienced relatively higher political stability?
