How do we measure for those capabilities?

Dr. Bhim Subba in his preliminary work, ““Serving the People” in Crisis: Pandemic Philanthropy in India and China” analyses comparative datasets/studies of India &amp; China and study the process and trends of giving back to the society. In “Algorithmic Governance and the Platform Economy through the Covid-19 Pandemic”, Ms. Sowmiya Ashok compares food delivery platforms in China and India and found that in both cases the delivery workers bore the brunt of an already punishing year.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
