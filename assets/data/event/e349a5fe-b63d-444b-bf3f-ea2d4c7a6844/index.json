A parallel trend has received much less attention: the revival and strengthening of the CCP’s Leninist traditions. This Leninist revival is manifest in several ways, including the creation of party organizations in private enterprises and civil society organizations. In this talk, Bruce Dickson will discuss the CCP’s Leninist revival, based on his recently published book, The Party and the People: Chinese Politics in the 21st Century (Princeton 2021).</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
