It was more than student demonstration against unfair treatment of China at the Paris Peace Conference; it was a “movement of and for the people”. It was a movement that gave birth to a range of new ideas and “shaped China’s momentous twentieth century” by initiating political development and cultural renaissance in Chinese society. This seminar, on the eve of the May Fourth anniversary, has been drawn out of the recently published volume titled,&nbsp;<em>China's May Fourth Movement: New Narratives and Perspectives,</em>&nbsp;by Routledge (International). Edited by Prof. Sabaree Mitra, this volume provides critical insights into the MFM from interdisciplinary perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>This seminar looks at various facets of the MFM– the development of the May Fourth Spirit (MFS), Lu Xun’s contributions and its impact on the Indian public sphere. Prashant Kaushik in his presentation, “The MFS and the Communist Party of China: Evolution and Significance of an Umbilical Relationship” shows how the MFS has been attributed with different connotations during different eras of the CPC’s history. Christian Uhl’s presentation is titled, “Evolution, Eternal Recurrence, and Lu Xun’s Struggle with the Aporetic Temporalities of Capitalist Modernity: Reapproaching Lu Xun’s Yecao (<em>Xu, Guoke, Ying de Gaobie)</em>”. He argues that “Darwinist ideas on evolution” were the most productive source of inspiration for the intellectuals of the MFM. Through an analysis of Lu Xun's Yecao, he demonstrates that this oeuvre has universal significance as the manifestation of a profound struggle in the dimension of time. Natasha Nongbri in her presentation on “The MFM in Indian Newsprint: Glimpses through the Times of India” argues that the May Fourth Movement became a metaphor for change that left an impression on the then Indian public sphere, providing a backdrop for the emergence of a pan-Asian solidarity movement.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
