But what happens when rising powers like China with very different legal and political systems begin investing abroad on a vast scale? Our speaker, Matthew Erie, associate&nbsp;professor at the University of Oxford, responded to this question by launching a six-year project, called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cld.web.ox.ac.uk/\">China, Law, and Development</a>,&nbsp;and inviting scholars around the world to participate in gathering empirical evidence about the legal underpinnings of China’s worldwide investments, and whether or how China has disrupted prior assumptions about the relationship between law and development. In this talk, he will introduce the concept of “law as infrastructure” to make sense of the strategies and challenges of the People’s Republic of China. Rather than a “clash of civilizations” or a world remade in China’s image, law as infrastructure points to a process of layering, assembling, and bundling different laws and legal regimes including new law that is integrated within existing frameworks, epistemic communities, and institutions, as well as the creation of new infrastructures in emerging sectors such as renewable energy. Chinese law as global infrastructure has implications not only for commercial transactions but also for core fundamentals of public ordering, including rights, equity, and justice, in China and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
