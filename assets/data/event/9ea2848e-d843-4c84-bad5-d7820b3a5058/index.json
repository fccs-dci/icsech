Such inequality is commonly attributed to geography, access to resources, and recent political developments. In Corporate Conquests, Pat Giersch provides a challenge to these conventional understandings by tracing the disempowerment of minority communities to the very beginnings of China&#039;s modern development. Focusing on the emergence of private and state corporations in Yunnan Province, the 1870s-1956, the book reveals how important new ideas and structures of power were forged, not along China&#039;s east coast, but along the nation&#039;s internal borderlands. It is a must-read for anyone wishing to learn about China&#039;s unique state capitalism and its contribution to inequality.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
