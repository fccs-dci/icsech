The work is based on Lim and Yahp’s research in 1999 into street performances surrounding the ‘Hungry Ghost Festival’ in Penang, Malaysia. There, Chinese communities address and feed the ghosts that have been released from the underworld during the 7th lunar month of the Chinese calendar using street shrines of offerings and entertainments to appease unpredictable forces and renew social bonds. Lim and Yahp bring these ritual structures into a confrontation with the stories of an adjacent festival celebrating Chang-O, the moon goddess (Autumn Moon Festival), focussing on questions of subjecthood and more-than-human voicing to explode notions of ‘Chineseness’. The opera moves through polyasporic spaces wherein Penang street culture is re-imagined and literally transported to Australia, to Europe, Japan and back to Australia. Lim and Yahp will discuss aspects of the ‘polyasporic’ experience – travelling cultures and memory, ghostly autotopography, for example – in relation to the composition of the music and libretto as well as the work’s reception across the opera’s 6 seasons of performances (2000-2006).</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speakers</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Liza Lim</strong></strong>, Professor, the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.
