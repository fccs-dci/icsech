The older field is being reshaped in the 21st century with the convergence of climate change, biotechnology, geopolitics, and a political economy that contends with a dominance of multinational corporations. The new landscape demands more capacious frameworks for understanding food security—frameworks that simultaneously contend with local, national, and international measures; integrate environmental, animal, and human health; and bring into conversation the political economy of poverty eradication with climate change. Indeed, the Ukraine-Russia war vividly illustrates the need for more capacious frameworks for conceptualizing food security. The war has had a direct impact on food supplies and prices but also subsequently on debt and inflation worldwide, especially in the poorest countries. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Panelists will take on the challenge of deliberating on frameworks for food security by discussing the state of global food security; China’s and India’s domestic food security policies; and the influence of China and India on global institutions such as the Food and Agricultural Organization.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
