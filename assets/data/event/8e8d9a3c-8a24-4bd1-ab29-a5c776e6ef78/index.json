Chinaâ€™s consequent boom has now faltered and the Chinese state has become ever more aggressive in squeezing US and other foreign companies in order to facilitate Chinese capital exports. This has unleashed inter-capitalist competition and fuelled a US-China geopolitical rivalry that is unlikely to diminish even with the new Biden administration in Washington. Professor Hung will assess the prospects for the further playing-out of this rivalry by comparing it with UK-Germany rivalry at the beginning of the 20 th century and Europe-China relations at the present time.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
