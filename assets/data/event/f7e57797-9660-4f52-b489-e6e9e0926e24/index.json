Recently published by Columbia University Press, Guobin Yang’s book \"The Wuhan Lockdown\" recounts this history by presenting a galaxy of dramatic scenes and characters.</p>\n\n<p>This talk introduces the main features of the book and then zooms in on one theme – stories of ordinary people during the lockdown.
