This talk explores the effects of China’s catastrophic loss of 97 percent of its power generating capacity during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It looks at how wartime mobilization accelerated China’s transition towards coal as the main fuel source for power generation, led to the creation of a homegrown electrical equipment manufacturing industry, and inspired a vision of national reconstruction driven by massive hydropower projects.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
