In cross-cultural perspective East Asia’s envoy poetry is a highly distinctive phenomenon: during their encounters envoys communicated in the scripta (rather than lingua) franca of Literary Sinitic through “brush talk” on paper; they were Confucian literati eager to display their talent in collective poetry composition on set topics and shared rhyme schemes; and they learnt how to play with a common set of themes and tropes to convey courtesy and conviviality.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
