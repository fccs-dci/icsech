Chinese diplomacy in the past several years has become more assertive and its diplomats have used sharper language, earning them the title &quot;wolf warriors.&quot; The book traces the roots of China&#039;s approach to diplomacy back to the communist revolution of 1949 and tells the story of how it&#039;s evolved through social upheaval, famine, capitalist reforms and China&#039;s rise to superpower status. It draws on dozens of interviews and -- for the first time -- on the memoirs of more than 100 retired Chinese diplomats.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
