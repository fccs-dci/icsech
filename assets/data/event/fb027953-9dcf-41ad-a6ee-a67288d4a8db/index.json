Despite the array of various debt, equity and grant financing mechanisms China’s policy banks have at their disposal, separate multi-stakeholder funds have emerged that are increasing Chinese financing capacity for overseas development projects. Since the mid-2000s, Chinese public and private financing institutions have established specialized investment funds that primarily provide equity financing to sector and region-specific development projects. These 'Overseas Development Investment Funds' (ODIFs) are an increasingly mentioned feature of Chinese foreign direct investment and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) financing instruments. Drawing on forthcoming research, Oyintarelado (Tarela) Moses, Data Analyst and Database Manager for the Global China Initiative at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, and Laura Gormley, Research Assistant to the Global China Initiative, will explore the unique features, financing capacity, policy implications and future potential of China’s ODIFs.</p>\n\n<p>Join us on Tuesday, November 8, for a discussion on diversifying the BRI with China’s ODIFs. This webinar is part of the Fall 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
