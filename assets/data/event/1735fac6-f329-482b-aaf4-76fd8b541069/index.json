New tensions with Japan’s neighbor Russia join existing concerns over North Korea’s ballistic missile tests and China’s activities in the East China Sea. Responding to China’s pressure, enhancing the US-Japan alliance, addressing economic security challenges, and bolstering efforts to maintain Japan’s own defense capabilities have all assumed new importance. Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C., and a leading expert on Japan’s security policy, will discuss how recent events are affecting the process of revising Japan’s National Security Strategy and the likely direction of its new security policy. Bruce Aronson will moderate the discussion.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
