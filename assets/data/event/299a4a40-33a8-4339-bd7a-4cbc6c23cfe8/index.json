Rather than attempting the unfeasible—countering their current and future initiatives and forestalling subsequent provocations—Wyne argues that Washington should formulate a more practical, creative, and sustainable foreign policy that can advance U.S. national interests regardless of what steps Beijing and Moscow take, and that recent competitive missteps give the U.S. space to undertake this task.</span><span style=\"mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;\ncolor:black;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p>For more information about&nbsp;<i>America's Great-Power Opportunity</i>&nbsp;or to purchase a copy, please click&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Great-Power-Opportunity-Revitalizing-Competition/dp/1509545549/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
