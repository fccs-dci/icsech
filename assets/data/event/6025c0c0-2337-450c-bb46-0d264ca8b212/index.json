What have been the consequences of China's COVID policies on the operations of foreign companies? What is the actual situation concerning \"de-coupling\" in the supply chain space? We will also identify and discuss key trends likely to occur in China's business relationship with foreign companies in the near term.</p>\n\n<p>Please join us for this special session.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
