Or, looking at corruption from an even more positive perspective, why are some countries able to achieve rapid economic growth under rampant corruption? I offer an explanation for this puzzle from the perspective of an informal governance mechanism and the role of trust in the corruption-efficiency relationship. Using the cases of China and the Philippines and multi-country statistical data, I show that, ironically, corruption and trust, two morally opposite behaviors, have become bedfellows in driving economic growth in relation-based societies. This talk is based on my recent book, Bribery and Corruption in Weak Institutional Environments: Connecting the Dots from a Comparative Perspective (Cambridge University Press, 2019).</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
