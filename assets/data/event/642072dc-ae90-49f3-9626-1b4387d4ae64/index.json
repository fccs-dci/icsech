Towards this, China changed its military strategic guideline (军事战 略方针) to ‘winning informatized local wars’ (打赢信 息化局部战争) in 2014 and further revised it to ‘Military Strategic Guidelines for the New Era’(新时代军事战略方针). The new military strategic guidelines are likely to emphasise on ’intelligentization’ (智能化) in future. What is ‘intelligentization’? How does it differ from Artificial Intelligence? How is the PLA likely to employ ‘intelligentization’? Where does it stand as on date? What are the envisaged future trends? This seminar looks at the doctrinal, technological and organisational changes in the PLA and attempts to answer the above questions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
