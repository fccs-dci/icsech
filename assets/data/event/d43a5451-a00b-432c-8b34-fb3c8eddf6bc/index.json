Yet for all this massive effort, a guerilla army of writers, intellectuals, filmmakers, and other thinkers promulgate and preserve history from below. They are not overseas dissidents or historians but people inside Chinese who seek to bring light to China&#039;s recent past, filling in the silence that has suffused society when it comes to sensitive subjects.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
