The COVID 19 pandemic has revealed how this field, while guided by expertise from Geneva and Seattle, has not taken into account public health models adopted by many Asian countries. By comparing experiences of countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe, the discussion hopes to put a critical lens on what regimes of global health have privileged – and systematically ignored.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
