They are iconic not only for what they stand for in their immediate contexts but also for their association with a certain way of life in Hong Kong. But this webinar is not an exercise of nostalgia. It offers an introduction to this integral part of the visual culture of the city, and it provides an opportunity for us to reflect on not only the designs and uses of neon signs but also some recent initiatives to archive and study them.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
