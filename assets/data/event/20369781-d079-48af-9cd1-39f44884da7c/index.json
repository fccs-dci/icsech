No sooner US influence started to recede with the conclusion of the Cold War, than South China Sea starts to experience the hegemonic encroachment of rising China. Taiwan feels the heat of increasing PRC pressure upon her precarious independent status in the global arena, while Hong Kong’s freedom once guaranteed by the Basic Law and the ‘1 country 2 systems’ principle has been continuously and methodically dismantled from the earliest years of Xi Jinping’s presidency. The democratizing trend of Southeast Asia has suffered similar setbacks, with Thailand and Myanmar reverting back to military rule and returning to draconian measures to suppress pro-democracy protesters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The online pro-democracy network known as the ‘Milk Tea Alliance,’ which emerged in April 2020, among netizens of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, is the first online movement to vocalize what has been a long standing yet unspeakable suspicion among the younger generation of this region—that the Chinese Communist Government is a mutual obstacle for democratization of the Asia-Pacific. For the first time in history, the fight for Taiwan independence, Hong Kong’s freedom, and Thailand and Myanmar’s democratization becomes one and the same, united by the superpower threat against democracy and human rights in the form of PRC influence across the region. The ‘Milk Tea Alliance’ quest for freedom is the last of the unfinished business from the colonial era. It is the long overdue last wave of decolonization in Asia.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
