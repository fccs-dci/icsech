In addition to increasing road-mobile ballistic missiles, the current phase involves construction of what appears to be more than 300 missile silos, launching additional ballistic missile submarines, as well as adding a nuclear bomber leg to its arsenal. Unlike previous nuclear modernization phases, the current upgrade is highly visible on commercial satellite images, which allows the public to participate in the debate about the nature and implications of Chinese nuclear forces in a way that has never been possible before. Dr. Hans Kristensen will outline his work on monitoring Chinese nuclear forces via analysis of satellite images and production of the Nuclear Notebook and discuss potential implications for Chinese nuclear strategy and policy. Mr. Prasad will examine the implications of China’s nuclear modernisation for India and India’s response. </span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
