While this approach may seem distinct, it follows the normative trend of linking political questions to legality, like any other nation-state, through local norms creation. This discussion examines how China navigates the complexities of historical claims and security concerns through a range of measures such as Political Settlement, Domestication, National Integration, Balancing Local Political and Economic Culture, and Social Governance. These approaches are selectively employed based on China’s desired outcome, using tactics such as persuasion, intimidation, the use of force, and asymmetric power relations in response to other parties’ rejection of its claims. The Speaker also analyses how China uses exceptional measures and mobilises domestic public support to achieve its objectives. Using a trend analysis of the securitisation of political questions and tracing foreign policy content in China’s security debates and security content in its foreign policy documents and doctrines, the talk aims to offer an alternative understanding of China’s securitisation strategy in navigating the complexities of historical claims and security concerns in the geopolitical arena.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
