A French Catholic missionary, Caubrière arrived in Manchuria on the eve of the Boxer Uprising in 1899 and was murdered on the eve of the birth of the People’s Republic of China in 1948. Living with ordinary Chinese people for half a century, Caubrière’s documentation opens a unique window into everyday interaction between Manchuria’s grassroots society and various international players. His gripping accounts personalize the interplay of missions and empire in local society and illuminate vital issues in modern Chinese history, such as mass migration and religion, tensions between church and state, and the importance of cross-cultural exchanges in everyday life in Chinese Catholic communities. This intense transformation of Manchurian local society embodies the clash of both domestic and international tensions in the making of modern China.</p>\n\n<p>S﻿peaker's Bio:</p>\n\n<p>Ji Li is an Associate Professor of History at the University of Hong Kong.
