Set, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Pathways” (<em>Dao</em>道) in classical Daoist discourses, not really “ready-made,” tend to make themselves anew quite readily, all the way through; “way-making (<em>dao</em>) that can be put into words,” “eloquently couched” as such (信言不美 美言不信<em>Daodejing</em>&nbsp;道德經CH 8), “is not really way-making” (道可道非常道), says the old sage (老子), who also says that “those who know will not say it, and those who say would not know it” (知者不言 言者不知).&nbsp;<em>What</em>&nbsp;is he saying?&nbsp;<em>Dao</em>&nbsp;is effable and ineffable. So what? What are we supposed to do?</p>\n\n<p>Today, which GPS will take us to this Daoist “door of all wonders” (衆妙)? What kind of threshold<em>ing</em>, not just gatekeeping, would be possible? Taking the auto-poetic generativity of such good old Daoist paradoxes and ironies as a philosophically renewable energy, this seminar, the first in the series, on the Daoist PhiloPoetics of transitive ambiguation introduces ways to reboot&nbsp;<em>Laozi</em>&nbsp;(老子) and&nbsp;<em>Zhuangzi</em>&nbsp;(庄子) translingually, focusing on their metamorphic — metaphorical and metaphysical — avant-gardism, their waiting (<em>weiding</em>未定&nbsp;<em>Zhuangzi</em>&nbsp;04) game.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
