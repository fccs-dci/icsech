International law reflects the global distribution of power and defending a rules-based order against China’s bid for hegemony in the SCS is critical for the upholding of international law. The criticality of Southeast Asian countries in upholding rules-based order has been highlighted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), under various initiatives. The Webinar will discuss recent developments pertaining to SCS to understand the Chinese presence and other stakeholders in the region and implications for Rules-based order.</span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
