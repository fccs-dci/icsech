As well as founding hospitals and medical schools the medical customs officers&#039; and missionaries&#039;s efforts in knowledge production were also a key driving force behind the development of modern medicine in China during the late Qing period. Among such efforts, the publication of Medical Reports and the China Medical Journal was the most representative. They became landmarks in the history of modern medicine in China. This study examines the production of knowledge among the medical communities of foreign doctors during the late Qing period by applying the approach of natural language processing in digital humanities to analysing Medical Reports and the China Medical Journal.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
