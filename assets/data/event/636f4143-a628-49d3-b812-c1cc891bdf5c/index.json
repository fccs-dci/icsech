For the last two decades, China's sovereign funds have played a significant role in China's economy, mitigating financial crises and tempering exogenous shocks. In this talk, Zoe will discuss how sovereign funds have supported China's industrial policies by financing the state's procurement of strategic overseas assets, bankrolling Chinese enterprises' mergers and acquisitions abroad, and sponsoring the development of indigenous Chinese technology startups. As Zoe makes clear, sovereign funds are not just for oil exports. The CPC is a leader in both foreign exchange reserves investment and economic statecraft, using state capital to encourage domestic economic activity and create spheres of influence worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
