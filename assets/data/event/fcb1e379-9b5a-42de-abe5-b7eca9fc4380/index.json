Even though the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have significantly hindered two-way exchanges during the last three years, the overall environment is improving. Last November, leaders of both countries reaffirmed their commitment to continue supporting people-to-people exchange at their meeting in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping boldly announced the goal of welcoming 50,000 American students to visit China in the next 5 years. This announcement has created much excitement among educators and community leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Please join us in this special online event that brings together leaders dedicated to expanding US-China educational exchanges for a timely discussion on the new opportunities and challenges ahead.</p>\n\n<p>This program is a collaboration between the&nbsp;US Heartland China Association&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinainstitute.org/\">China Institute in America</a>.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
