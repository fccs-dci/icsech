The announcement of the 2014 Tibetan Rehabilitation Policy (TRP) saw an immediate backlash from the politically powerful All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union (AAPSU) and more recent outfits like the Students United Movement of All Arunachal (SUMAA). They are against providing temporary land tenure guarantees and welfare benefits to Tibetan refugees settled in the state, arguing that Tibetans are not indigenous to the state. The anti-refugee stance of the student groups must be contextualised within a broader history of refugee resettlement in the state, contemporary nationalist assertions that include ethnic binaries, pressures of land and competition for state welfare. This has produced threatening outcomes for the refugee communities including attacks on Tibetan owned businesses. This paper maps the local resistance to the TRP in West Kameng and Tawang districts comprising the Monyul region where the total Tibetan refugee presence is around 1.3% of the total combined population. The paper locates the resistance to the presence of this miniscule Tibetan population in the broader context of exclusionary narratives of blood and soil in this Indo-Tibetan borderland.</p>\n\n<p>With Tawang as a sensitive sector in the ongoing India-China border dispute, the importance of these local disaffections must be factored in with regard to Indian state-making in the region. In addition, the Buddhist population in the Himalayan belt is the core constituency with regard to the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai lama with long-term implications for Tibet, India and China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
