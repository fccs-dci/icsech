Topics we will cover include the film’s engagement with the city/country division, the romance genre, and stardom.<br />\nParticipants are invited to view the film in advance, which is available through DVD and various streaming services, including the online platform offered by Taiwan Film Festival Edinburgh this year. Links to watch the film are included on both the MCI Events webpage, and the Eventbrite registration page.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
