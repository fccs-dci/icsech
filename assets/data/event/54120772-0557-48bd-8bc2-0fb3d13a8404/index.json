The reader, practices of reading and the meanings and interpretations that (ordinary) readers arrive at very often are missing from the picture. The READCHINA virtual lecture series aims at filling this gap in research by focusing on practices of reading in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.<br />\nThis lecture series will take place at varying times on Tuesdays, running from Nov. 10, 2020 to Jan. 26, 2021 (with a three-week-long break during the holiday season). All sessions will start with two talks held back to back, followed by a brief statement from the discussant. The floor will then be open to all listeners for Q&amp;A via voice and text chat. More Details can be found on the lecture series webpage: <a href=\"https://readchina.github.io/conferences.html\">https://readchina.github.io/conferences.html</a> Looking forward to your participation!</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
