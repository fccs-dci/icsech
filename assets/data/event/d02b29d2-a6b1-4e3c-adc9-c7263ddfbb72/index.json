In this present era, the authorities over governing markets are being reconfigured to handle the consequences of prior era state capitalism. Such reconfiguration of market governance is achieved through the mobilization of legal institutions in two main directions: intensifying the presence of the regulatory state in the market, and shifting substantial market governance powers directly to the CCP.</p>\n\n<p>The talk is based on the book:&nbsp;<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/law-and-political-economy-in-china/A7F3DE5335EEBEA9F7800753EB6998D4\"><em>Law &amp; Political Economy in China: The Role of Law in Corporate Governance &amp; Market Growth</em></a>, Cambridge University Press (2023). The book analyzes four decades of market development in China [1978-2021], discussing the role of law as an internal party-state instrument for allocating political-economic power. A substantial part of the book is dedicated to observing how relations of political-economic power are legally configured through the (re)construction of corporate laws and legal institutions.</p>\n\n<p><a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"https://tamargo.huji.ac.il/\">Tami Groswald Ozery</a>&nbsp;is an Assistant Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
