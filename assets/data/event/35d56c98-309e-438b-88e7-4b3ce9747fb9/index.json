A majority of Taiwanese, however, disagree with any “one China” concept that implies Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic of China. Regardless of legal status, most people in Taiwan want to remain a self-governing liberal democracy. Our speakers — Jerome A. Cohen, founder and faculty director emeritus of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute, and Yu-Jie Chen, a USALI affiliated scholar and assistant research professor at Taiwan’s Academia Sinica — will talk about what “one China” means on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwanese attitudes towards their own identity and whether a peaceful solution can be found to this increasingly dangerous dispute.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
