Contesting the presumption that a smoothly-communicated physical and spiritual liberation defined the program, Professor Miao argues that recurrent reciprocal misunderstandings deeply marked the exchange, because of the American teachers’ and Chinese students’ profoundly different conceptions of kinesthesia, pedagogical approach, and freedom. These missteps generated new methods of dance modernization and significantly shifted the history of Chinese modern dance.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
