While in fact, the awareness of the importance of the food industry for a developed society had only gradually emerged, a number of high officials in the Chinese Communist Party quickly understood its relevance. By 1981, the issue of the food industry was openly addressed in an editorial in the People&#039;s Daily on October 18. It announced the directives of the Central Committee and the State Council on the need to develop a Chinese food industry worthy of the name. A National Association of Food Industries had been created in the spring and a first draft of a development program had been presented to its members at its meeting in October. It would serve as a framework for a profound evolution of minds in terms of food, both daily and festive.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
