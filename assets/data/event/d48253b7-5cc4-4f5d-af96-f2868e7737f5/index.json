This study examines the last forty years of the world’s largest for-profit education industry that exists on the margins of China’s socialist education system. Drawing on in-depth interviews, internal archives, and participant observation in 28 leading supplemental education organisations, this study found that ambiguities in the industry empowered socially marginalised entrepreneurs to enter a previously state-dominated market. While some scholars have argued that China’s education privatisation is a top-down process, this study proposes a new bottom-up process that highlights the role of opportunist organisations as agents of change. It also illustrates that while opportunism leaves destruction in its wake, it can also drive the formation and evolution of China’s market economy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Le Lin&nbsp;</strong>is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa. His research centers on organizations, work/occupations, economic sociology and social stratification in China. His first book,<em>&nbsp;The Fruits of Opportunism: Noncompliance and the Evolution of China’s Supplemental Education Industry</em>, was published by the University of Chicago Press in 2022. This book draws on the privatisation, marketisation and financialisation of China’s supplemental education sector to shed new light China’s market transition and economic/organisational changes. His articles have appeared in journals such as&nbsp;<em>Socio-Economic Review</em>,&nbsp;<em>Higher Education&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Global Perspectives</em>, and have won awards from the American Sociological Association and the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics.
