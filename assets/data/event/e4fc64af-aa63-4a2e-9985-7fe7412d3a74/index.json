The composer&#039;s perseverance in the face of adversity and his musical genius resonated in a young nation searching for a way forward. Beethoven remained a durable part of Chinese life in the decades that followed, proving a remarkable chameleon; an icon to reformers, intellectuals, music fans and party cadres alike, playing a role in major historical events from the May Fourth Movement to the normalization of US-China relations.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
