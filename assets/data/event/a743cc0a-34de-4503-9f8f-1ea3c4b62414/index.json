They present a theoretical framework of policy implementation that combines collaboration between public and private sectors (“Public-Private Partnership,” or PPP) to efficiently deal with urgent crises such as COVID-19. The authors explain the role of new institutions prompted by policy failure precedence (Time 1: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015) that at a later time period (Time 2: COVID-19 in 2020) allow for the activation of PPPs with the aim to extend the political life of incumbent leaderships.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
