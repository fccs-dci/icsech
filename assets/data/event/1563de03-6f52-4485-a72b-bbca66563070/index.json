The talk, titled <i>Nanjing City Wall: A Case Study on Digital Humanities and Community Involvement in Heritage Protection</i>, will take place on Monday, August 28, in LETT 01.52 (Jos Creten) at KU Leuven, at 2 PM.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Century&quot;,serif\"><strong>About the talk</strong>: Nanjing city wall surrounds the city's core urban area, forming its backbone and intimately connecting with the community. In order to create a closer bond between the city wall and the public, the Nanjing City Wall Protection and Management Center launched two projects:</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Century&quot;,serif\">1. The project <i>Oral History Collection of the Nanjing City Wall</i> adopts a new model for collecting, storing, and publishing individual memories of the city wall. This project also includes courses about repairing and maintaining the wall, preserving cultural heritage, working with personal memories, etc. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Century&quot;,serif\">2. The public campaign titled<i> Bring Every Brick Home to Protect Nanjing City Wall</i> was launched in 2016. The campaign actively engages the community in the preservation of Nanjing's city wall, which has been damaged by various human activities. The campaign encouraged the community to provide information about city wall bricks and donate them to the Center, where they were used for maintenance of the wall. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Century&quot;,serif\">The Center is also engaged in digital documentation of the city wall: nearly every brick has an inscription, with a location, time, names of senior officials, and even the information on potters and brick craftsmen can be found on the bricks. The Center uses a 3D scanner to collect the inscriptions on the bricks and records the locations through GIS.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Century&quot;,serif\"><strong>About Dr. Lianyu Jin</strong>: Lianyu Jin is an associate investigator at Nanjing City Wall Protection and Management Center.
