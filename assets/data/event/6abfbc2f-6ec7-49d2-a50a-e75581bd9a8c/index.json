Examining Chinese-language sources such as newspaper and magazine reviews and rare original programs held in the University of Michigan Asia Library&#039;s Chinese Dance Collection, Professor Wilcox reconstructs the circulation and reception of this work in China, arguing that the production represented an attempt to create a leftist Sino-Japanese counter-public at a time of Cold War tensions between the two countries. She suggests that the Japanese ballet dancers&#039; cross-ethnic performances of Chinese characters critically reconfigured pre-1945 Japanese imperialist discourses of pan-Asianism, leading them to be interpreted as acts of inter-ethnic solidarity in the context of 1950s Asian internationalism.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
