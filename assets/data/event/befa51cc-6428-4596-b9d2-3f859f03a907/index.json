This film documents how four Taiwanese ladies, all from different communities – Wu Hsiu-Mei, Chen Tao, Lin Shen Chung and Chen Lian-Hua – overcame grave physical and mental trauma and grew in their attitudes toward life, through 16 years of Physical and Mental Health Workshops. At the workshop, they revisited their wounds, released their rage, gazed at their aging selves, and reaffirmed their values.</p>\n<p>In cooperation with Taipei Women’s Rescue Foundation and Professor Hsiu-Ching Wu (Department of Motion Pictures, National Taiwan University of Arts), we will show the 76-minute documentary online on 5 November 2021.
