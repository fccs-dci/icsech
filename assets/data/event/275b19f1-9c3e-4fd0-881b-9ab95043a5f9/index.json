O’Connor Professor of Kellogg MEDS and Dept. of Economics by courtesy appointment at Northwestern University, and moderated by&nbsp;<strong>Shang-Jin Wei</strong>, N. T. Wang Professor of Chinese Business and Economy and Professor of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n<p>Professor&nbsp;<strong>Nancy Qian</strong>&nbsp;will speak about her research on the long-run impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese immigration to the United States in 1882. Her research shows that the Act reduced the size of the Chinese population and labor supply across all major economic sectors, and worsened the economic outcomes of not only the Chinese who remained but also those of the other ethnic groups in the United States. She will connect the historical study with the present-day development in the country.</p>\n\n<p>What you'll learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Why the implications of the Chinese Exclusion Act,&nbsp;which banned Chinese immigration to the United States in 1882, are still being felt today</li>\n\t<li>How the act reduced income for non-Chinese workers (the opposite of what was intended!)</li>\n\t<li>What the impact was on manufacturing, mining, and agriculture</li>\n\t<li>Why the overall economic development of the United States was dampened in subsequent decades</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>\n\n<p>5:00-6:00PM - Lecture<br />\n6:00-7:00PM - Reception</p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To register to attend this event&nbsp;<strong>in-person</strong>, please register&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-impact-of-the-chinese-exclusion-act-on-the-us-economy-tickets-431807968257\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>. *Please note that attendees will need to show proof of&nbsp;their primary series and one booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines.</strong></p>\n</section>\n</article>\n"}}},"context":{}}
