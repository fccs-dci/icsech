The major showdowns in international affairs have been intense clashes over control of the Eurasian continent and its maritime approaches. Whenever the Land Powers have tried to unify the supercontinent, the world’s strategic core, the preeminent sea powers have sought to keep Eurasia split. The hot wars, cold wars, and proxy wars that characterized the twentieth century were merely chapters in this longer story. The American rivalry with China is now playing out against the same tableau. Halford Mackinder’s 1904 thesis rested on the premise that a high-stakes struggle over Eurasia and the world beyond, was imminent. The brutal history subsequently, would show how right he was. This talk highlights the German attempts to connect Eurasia using Railways in the beginning of the twentieth century and how its Berlin-Baghdad rail project that threatened the predominance of sea routes in plying global trade became one of the reasons for World War I.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
