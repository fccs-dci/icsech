Tomoaki Ishigaki, a minister at the Embassy of Japan to the United States, and Pete Ogden, vice president for energy, climate, and the environment at the United Nations Foundation, will explain how the US and Japan have interacted with each other and other major players in climate negotiations, analyze the dynamics between domestic constraints and international action, and suggest areas for closer cooperation to address the accelerating global crisis. &nbsp;Bruce Aronson will moderate the discussion.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
