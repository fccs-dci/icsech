China has restricted opportunities for contact between American and Chinese scholars and students, while in the United States, concerns about national security, intellectual property loss, Chinese competitiveness, and “pro-China” views on U.S. campuses have triggered a variety of responses including visa denials, re-evaluation of faculty ties to Chinese institutions, and federal prosecutions. Are the core American values of open research and academic freedom at risk as a result?
