Mass shortages and unemployment combined with decaying institutions to throw economies and societies in turmoil. Three decades later, Eastern Europe has transformed. Of the 23 countries to become high income since 1992, nine are in Eastern Europe. In the 1980s, Poland had a lower per capita GDP than Suriname; today, the total GDP of the EU states in Eastern Europe is larger than the GDP of Russia. In much of the region, corruption has declined, while education, health, and other social and economic indicators have improved.<br />\n<br />\nHow did these changes occur, and what dilemmas did Eastern European countries encounter during the transformation of their economies and institutions? This panel features experts on Eastern Europe to discuss causes behind the region’s economic problems, and the challenges of rejuvenating economies and institutions after the end of the Cold War. In doing so, panelists will discuss the potential lessons that East Asian countries can learn from the challenges and successes of Eastern Europe’s economic reforms and transformation.</p>\n\n<p>This event is the second part of a two-part series of panels.
