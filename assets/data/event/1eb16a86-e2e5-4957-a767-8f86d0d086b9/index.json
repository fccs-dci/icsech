For more than two thousand years, the writings of the Confucian philosopher Mengzi have been a source of guidance and inspiration for those set on doing something to improve the state of the world. Doing What You Really Want: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mengzi presents a coherent, systematic, and accessible explanation of Mengzi's philosophy. The book covers everything from the place of human beings in nature to human psychology and philosophy of emotions, to the various ways in which we can deliberately change and cultivate ourselves. Mengzi was concerned not just with theory but also effective action. Perkins thus includes a collection of practical advice and a Confucian analysis of politics-oriented toward how individuals can make a difference in the world. This event is co-sponsored by the UHM Department of Philosophy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">Franklin Perkins is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa and is the editor of the journal Philosophy East and West.
