Two scholarships for a period of five years each, are awarded to selected candidates, enrolled in the doctoral Programme in Indian universities. In the first year the selected candidate would strengthen Chinese language capabilities in India and thereafter spend one year in a Chinese university and the third year at the HYI in the United States. The recipients of the scholarship work across disciplines and are based in different universities in India. In the panel discussion, the panelists will share their journey as recipients of the prestigious fellowship and how it has helped them on their evolution and development as scholars/academics/researchers.
