These were in dialogue with each other and the questions and the methods of looking into the ‘strange’ remained the same. However, the ‘strange’ was invariably discussed as a singular category, which did not do justice to the Chinese philosophical tradition. In the discussions of the master philosophers, the knowledge of the ‘strange’ comes through an emotion or a way of perception, out of which the emotion rises. Zhuangzi or the Daoist schools, especially delved deep into such a knowledge structure. With Daoism, the knowledge of the unknown and the known were distinguished and repeatedly explained. This abundance of knowledge is something that has been associated with the ‘strange’ and especially those knowledge systems which are beyond the socially accepted norms. In the Indic/Sanskrit intellectual tradition it was mostly an effort to elucidate on what gives rise to the best kind of taste (<em>rasa</em>) and emotion whilst dealing with the complexity of those emotions. This tradition recognizes the ‘strange’ as the creation of ‘strange’/’fantastic’ on stage and it is theoretically done through dramatic application of emotions – a complex process that includes aesthetics of rasas and how to perceive it and by whom. The speaker argues that ‘strange’ is not merely a common and overused category in the philosophical traditions, but refers to a kind of knowledge production that relates to the systems beyond those socially and historically accepted parameters. This discussion (which is a work in progress) is also a way to search for an appropriate method and a theoretical base for its further elucidation.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
