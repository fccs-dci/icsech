Yet, little is known on how citizens see these actors’ different types of engagements with their host countries. We are drawing on an original survey dataset from South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Nigeria (N=8000) and present novel findings of this larger project. Who do citizens prefer their country to align with – China, Western countries, others or none? What explains citizens' alignment preferences? To what degree does Chinese soft power contribute to its overseas image and what other factors determine how citizens of these selected countries view China?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wiebke</strong><strong>&nbsp;Rabe&nbsp;</strong>(Presenter) is Assistant Professor of International Relations at the University of Bremen.
