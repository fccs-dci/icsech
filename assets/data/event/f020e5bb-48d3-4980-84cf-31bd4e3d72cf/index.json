Yet few know exactly what it means, let alone its&nbsp;fascinating history. In <i>Laws&nbsp;</i><i>of&nbsp;</i><i>the Land</i>, Tristan Brown&nbsp;tells the story of the important roles—especially legal&nbsp;ones—played by fengshui in Chinese society during&nbsp;China’s last imperial dynasty, the Manchu Qing (1644–1912).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nEmploying archives from Mainland China and Taiwan&nbsp;that have only recently become available, this is the first&nbsp;book to document fengshui’s invocations in Chinese law&nbsp;during the Qing dynasty. Facing a growing population,&nbsp;dwindling natural resources, and an overburdened&nbsp;rural government, judicial administrators across China&nbsp;grappled with disputes and petitions about fengshui in&nbsp;their efforts to sustain forestry, farming, mining, and&nbsp;city planning. <i>Laws</i><i>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;</i><i>Land</i> offers a radically new&nbsp;interpretation of these legal arrangements: they&nbsp;worked. An intelligent, considered, and sustained&nbsp;engagement with fengshui on the ground helped the&nbsp;imperial state keep the peace and maintain its&nbsp;legitimacy, especially during the increasingly turbulent&nbsp;decades of the nineteenth century. As the century came&nbsp;to an end, contentious debates over industrialization&nbsp;swept across the bureaucracy, with fengshui invoked by&nbsp;officials and scholars opposed to the establishment of&nbsp;railways, telegraphs, and foreign-owned mines.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nDemonstrating that the only way to understand those&nbsp;debates and their profound stakes is to grasp fengshui’s&nbsp;longstanding roles in Chinese public life, <i>Laws</i><i>&nbsp;of the</i><i>&nbsp;Land </i>rethinks key issues in the history of Chinese law,&nbsp;politics, science, religion, and economics.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
