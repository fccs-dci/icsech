The law does all that – and in conjunction with the new Data Security Law and other new regulations, it will also have a huge impact within China’s borders by reining in big domestic internet companies when they collect user data, make decisions with it, and seek to monetize it. Graham Webster, editor-in-chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, will explain how the new PIPL came about, what it means for Chinese and foreign businesses, and how it fits into a much larger landscape of accelerating Chinese government regulation of the digital sphere. USALI Executive Director Katherine Wilhelm will moderate.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
