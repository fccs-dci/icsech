While much has been written about the discourses of familial relations in televisual culture since the late 1990s, no research has been done on the representation of this particularly gendered identity of SAHFs on the Chinese screen. This paper uses Marriage Battle, a TV drama series that revolves around the lives of three SAHFs, as a case study to examine how SAHFs are represented, so as to provide a new perspective to academic debates about the cultural production of gender difference and hierarchy in China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
