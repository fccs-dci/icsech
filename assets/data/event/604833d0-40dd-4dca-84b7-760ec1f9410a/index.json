This process is worth noting among the global&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; polities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; witness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unique&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; development versus sustainability dichotomy, different from the global North. The talk explicates state-led initiatives in both countries as they grapple with environmental issues. In order to comprehensively understand the policy practices in these countries, the securitization framework of the Copenhagen School in International Relations is employed. New political realities in the global South are opportunities to reimagine the empirical and theoretical boundaries of existing IR theories. It is therefore surprising that the role of societal factors is not sufficiently addressed in the existing securitization framework. Application of the securitization framework can reveal processes like the emergence of non-state agencies in rigid polities such as China, besides bringing out other manifestations of public participation in environmental policy making in order to collectively reimagine our understanding about actors, processes and outcomes in the construction of the securitization framework itself.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,serif\">China and India, as two significant economies with growing global political influence, are undergoing a noteworthy process known as \"greening.\" This process involves incorporating ecological considerations into policy formulation and its implementation. It is particularly significant in the context of global Southern polities because these nations witness a unique&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; development versus sustainability dichotomy, which differs from the approach in the global North. The talk will delve into the state-led initiatives in both China and India as they grapple with pressing environmental issues. In order to comprehensively understand the policy practices in these countries, the securitization framework of the Copenhagen School in International Relations is employed. New political realities in the global South are opportunities to reimagine the empirical and theoretical boundaries of existing IR theories. It is, therefore, surprising that the role of societal factors is not sufficiently addressed in the existing securitization framework. Application of the securitization framework can reveal processes like the emergence of non-state agencies in rigid polities such as China, besides bringing out other manifestations of public participation in environmental policy making. This, in turn, prompts us to collectively rethink our understanding about the actors, processes, and outcomes within the construction of the securitization framework itself.</span></span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
