But limited studies have focused on parenting needs in parents of children with ASD, especially Chinese parents. Different parenting styles can be found in different cultures and different cultures may result in different parenting needs. In this lecture, Dr. Hsu-Min Chiang will present her study focusing on the needs of parents of children with ASD in the United States, Macau, and Taiwan in support services to help them reduce parenting stress and improve their children’s functioning. The audience will learn about these parents’ needs and the differences between Chinese American parents and non-American Chinese parents in support services. She will also share her clinical experiences and some practical strategies when providing support to Chinese parents across different countries.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
