Our mapping of religious mutations and issues in Southeast Asia requires an appropriate and dynamic definition of this space, which has been the site of proselytizing networks from outside/within Asia, whose actions are often justified by humanitarian ideals. Interestingly, a series of Southeast Asian missionary networks or strategies have recently been giving rise to complex ‘reversed missions.’ In a comparative approach, case studies of Evangelical-Pentecostal, Islamic and Buddhist missionary programs in Southeast Asia since the 1950s will be examined. As a result, contemporary religious dynamics will be considered as a circulatory and interactive process consisting of actors and networks, ideas and values, and identity claims, situated at the crossroads of local, regional and global influences.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
