The speaker will elaborate on the nature and challenges of examining the unexpectedly vast amount of primary material and dwell on the current political challenges of working with the Soviet period sources. Dr. Simonson’s research project intends to uncover the complexities of Soviet Lithuanian children’s visual culture. It would reveal, among other things, the representations of Chinese history, culture, and people, in the context of related research on children’s literature, theatre and film, linking with Soviet ideology and geopolitical interests underlying the “fraternity of peoples”. It would also offer possible hypotheses with regard to the origins of present-day manifestations of racism. The research is developed at the intersection of ideologised Soviet children’s culture and postcolonial theory.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
