Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has recently started highlighting the importance of promoting “foreign-related rule of law,” a new category of law that knits together Chinese and international law to govern China’s offshore activities. One place to look for foreign-related rule of law in action is in Chinese-invested overseas special economic zones, which some foreign scholars view as extraterritorial zones under Chinese power and law. NYU Shanghai Professor Maria Adele Carrai will discuss her research of selected Chinese overseas economic zones and new forms of Chinese extraterritoriality.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
