India has launched several ambitious welfare schemes aimed at poverty alleviation, healthcare, food security, and right to work programs. By virtue of population size, these programs are among the largest social policy initiatives in the world. But they are also insightful examples of welfare provision based less on rights-based entitlements and more on achieving state goals of development, social stability, political loyalty, and promotion of more exclusive conceptions of citizenship. This panel explores changing welfare policies and politics in China and India, and their roles in anchoring new forms of authoritarian or illiberal governance.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
