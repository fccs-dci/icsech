Neighborhood cooperation arises where the state largely fails. It both facilitates the implementation of lockdown policies and provides services essential to the survival of Shanghai residents during such a lockdown. He will be joined by Kenney Zhu, a leader of the food supply team in his Shanghai neighborhood, who will share his experiences. Roderick M. Hills, professor of law at NYU School of Law, will moderate.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
