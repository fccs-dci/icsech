With a clear focus on a strong men’s national team, China’s professional football clubs should function as breeding grounds for local talent and a driver of a still comparatively underdeveloped football industry.</p>\n<p>Following the government’s call, football is seeing a huge boom in recent years, with numerous new actors with diverse goals entering Chinese professional football. But what drives this boom and its main actors? What are the motivations and constraints of Chinese football investors in the nexus between sport, business and politics? The talk tries to give answers to these questions and elaborate on the reforms six years after their launch.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
