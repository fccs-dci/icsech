This shift from state expropriation to market transfer has transformed the dynamics of land&nbsp;development while diversifying the types of corporate capital involved in land use. Based on research in Guangdong and&nbsp;Jiangsu provinces, I contrast two regimes of accumulation: property-led redevelopment in urban villages, and rural tourism&nbsp;projects spearheaded by agribusinesses and hospitality companies at the fringe of cities. By comparing&nbsp;how residents are&nbsp;incorporated or excluded from decision making, revenue generation and employment opportunities to different degrees, I&nbsp;examine the implications of these new dynamics for local development. I argue that, despite bringing more diversified&nbsp;development opportunities for residents, the reforms also create new inequalities while making&nbsp;bottom-up collective agency&nbsp;less likely.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
