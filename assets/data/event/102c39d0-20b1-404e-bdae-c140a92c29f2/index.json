This event will also feature Bruce Dickson, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at GW, as a discussant, and Richard Haddock, Program Associate at the East Asia National Resource Center, as a moderator. Dr. Rigger’s new book discusses how the once-secretive, isolated People’s Republic of China became the factory to the world. Dr. Rigger convincingly demonstrates that the answer is Taiwan. The Tiger Leading the Dragon traces the development of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic relationship and explores how Taiwanese firms and individuals transformed Chinese business practices. It also reveals their contributions to Chinese consumer behavior, philanthropy, religion, popular culture, and law.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
