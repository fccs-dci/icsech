The book argues that looking&nbsp;<em><em>at</em></em>—rather than&nbsp;<em><em>through</em></em>—images (literary, visual, musical, filmic etc.) can fundamentally alter the trajectory and indeed the terms of a historian’s work: images are constitutive rather than merely reflective of the histories that produce them. By showing how images of Mao have been read in different times and by different people in China and beyond, I am able to draw connections between his (visible) imaged body, picture power and its (invisible) emotional, experiential, sensual effects on the personal, national and global scale.</p>\n\n<p>At a moment when histories of global or transcultural Mao-ism are just beginning to appear, I am taking these as my point of departure, trying to understand, how Mao (and others) invested his body and performative gestures with special symbolic meaning, how his charismatic image was manufactured and how it plays out, successfully, in his own constituency and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will make visible some of the lasting shapes that Mao has assumed in the memory cultures of the present, and illustrate how his iconic image has affected and animated others, as reflections of how his ideas have been understood and applied. In reading his images intertextually, as visual biographies, so to speak, I am probing into how he is remembered and enshrined, or, put differently, how he lives on in people’s minds.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speaker</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Barbara Mittler</strong></strong>&nbsp;holds a Chair in Chinese Studies at CATS, the Center for Asian and Transcultural Studies at Heidelberg University which she helped co-found in 2019.
