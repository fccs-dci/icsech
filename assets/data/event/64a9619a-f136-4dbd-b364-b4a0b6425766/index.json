In addition, the theme of this year’s conference will be “Smart Data ╳ Digital Humanities.” We call on scholars to pool their knowledge to explore how we can convert massive quantities of disparate data preserved in digital archives, by means of the latest technological developments in semantic web and artificial intelligence, to enable large databases to serve not only as data silos passively searched by researchers, but to go further and become able to actively respond to researchers’ queries and ideas, providing knowledge graphs that dynamically link people to answers. In short, structuring data to make it more usable.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
