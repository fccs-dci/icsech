Cross-strait relations are at a standstill amid questions on the Biden administration’s commitments to Taipei, debates over “strategic ambiguity”, recent arms sales, and the evolving force postures of Beijing and Washington. In the South China Sea, freedom of navigation operations, negotiations over a joint Code of Conduct and the role of US defense treaties with Manila have yet to generate a sustainable path to de-escalation and stability.</p>\n<p>This discussion will explore the risk of hot conflict and evaluate the most serious flashpoints for regional instability. Speakers will review latent threat perceptions, the strategic sense of Taiwan as a “red line”, existing tools and mediating institutions for diplomatic engagement as well as crisis channels for military-to-military communication.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
