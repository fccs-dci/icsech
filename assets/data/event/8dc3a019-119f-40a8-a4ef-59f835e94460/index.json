It examines the drivers of China’s foreign policy with regard to the three countries along with highlighting the obstacles and apprehensions Beijing currently faces in its bilateral relations with them. It argues that China has transitioned from following a non-interference approach to South Asia to a more overt role. With this increased involvement in the countries’ domestic politics and getting caught up in domestic political and security issues, China appears to have overextended its engagement in Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Thus, rather than achieving its foreign policy objectives, Beijing is likely to get distracted, having to react to developments rather than paving the way for deeper engagement. Nevertheless, China’s influence in the region and its ability to recalibrate should not be underestimated, and India should remain vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
