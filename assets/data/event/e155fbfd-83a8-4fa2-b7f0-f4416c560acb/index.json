The event will feature Dr. Bingchun Meng from the London School of Economics and Dr. Amy Hanser from UBC’s Department of Sociology as a discussant. This event will be moderated by Dr. Julia Harten from UBC’s School of Community and Regional Planning.</p>\n<p>Dr. Meng will examine the Double Eleven shopping festival as a major discursive site where the hegemony of what she calls patriarchal capitalism with Chinese characteristics is articulated. The state, the market, the corporations and the media, both mainstream and social media, all played an important role in building up a national spending spree that is deeply embedded in the current class and gender structure of China. It is at the intersection of a dissipating socialist ethos, emerging economic stagnation, and ascending consumerism that the sexist discourse in relation to Double Eleven proliferates.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
