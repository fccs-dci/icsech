Later that day, Guiping would find herself betrayed not only by her husband, but by the court system and her own legal counsel. Taking this case as a point of departure, Ke Li recounts decades-long research on divorce litigation in rural China. Ultimately, this talk articulates a firm belief: divorce, seemingly prosaic, offers a unique window onto phenomena of great importance to sociologists, political scientists, sociolegal researchers, and China scholars.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This talk will be a hybrid event, taking place in the Moot Court in the New Building at John Jay.
