The Historical Earthquake Study Group (HESG) at Kyoto University, of which Dr. Hashimoto is a member, uses crowdsourcing to transcribe vast numbers of historical earthquake records. In 2017, the HESG launched Minna de Honkoku (<a href=\"https://honkoku.org/\">https://honkoku.org/</a>), inviting the general public to transcribe historical earthquake records via the Internet. This project also makes use of novel technologies such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and AI-based handwriting recognition (HWR).</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
