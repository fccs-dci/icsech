The governments in most developing countries will have less resources to use industrial policies in the post-pandemic recovery. With less and limited resources, the governmentâ€™s industrial policy should aim for quick wins by helping existing firms, reinvigorating the existing industrial parks and retaining the existing foreign direct investments before the situation returns to normal.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Join us on Tuesday, September 13, for a discussion with Justin Yifu Lin on the future of industrialization in a post COVID-19 pandemic world.
