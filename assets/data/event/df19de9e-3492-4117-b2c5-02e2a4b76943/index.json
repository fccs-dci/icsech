Some have suggested that Chinese progress has been largely the product of extensive &quot;borrowing&quot; from abroad.<br />\nFrom this perspective, China has been a major beneficiary from cross border S&amp;T cooperation and collaboration. Moreover, there are those that have suggested that China basically has been a &quot;free rider&quot; by taking advantage of the openness of Western countries in terms of the free flow of scientific knowledge and information.<br />\nUsing the results of recent research, Dr. Caroline Wagner will analyze the evolving role of Chinese scientists in the international science community. She will highlight the ways in which China&#039;s steady integration into international research networks has helped China overcome the fact that it still only spends 5-6% of its R&amp;D budget on basic research.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
