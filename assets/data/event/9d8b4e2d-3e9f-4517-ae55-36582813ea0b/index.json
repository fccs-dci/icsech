In this talk, I propose a critical reassessment of this understudied text by focusing on features of its narrative style and structure that enhanced both its promotion of lay Buddhist practices and its entertainment value. Between scenes of moralistic instruction come dramatic instances of shocking violence, ironic humor, and romantic intimacy. In doing so, I depart from earlier treatments of the text as a repository of premodern Chinese female misery. Instead of reading Liu Xiang as a story that reflected the plight of female audiences, can we read it as a story that brought its Qing audiences pleasure, both in their piety and their need for a good tale?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
