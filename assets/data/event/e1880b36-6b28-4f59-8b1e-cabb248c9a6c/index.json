Jost’s book project offers a theory of the origins and consequences of national security institutions, coupling an original cross-national time series dataset with new archival and interview data from China, Taiwan, India and Pakistan. Other research projects employ qualitative, statistical and experimental methods to address theoretical puzzles regarding the politics of elite advisers, bureaucracies, and international security across a variety of regional contexts.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
