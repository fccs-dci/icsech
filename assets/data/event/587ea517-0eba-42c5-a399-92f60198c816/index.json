This scrutiny is not novel. Historically, China's population and its influence on economy and society has been a subject of both domestic and international discourse. China's unprecedented and forced population control for almost four decades, since the 1980s, in favour of a near total single-child generation, has had a deep impact on its domestic and foreign policy. The countryâ€™s rapid transition from a green to a silver economy, due to complex demographic challenges, is certain to have far-reaching implications for China's domestic socio-political and economic stability. Of greater concern is the fact that it also seems to be emerging as a significant factor in the country's military and defence policy, as well as in its ability to shape global politics. China's success in overcoming these challenges effectively, will shape its social, economic, political, and military standing - both on the domestic and the global stage. Consequently, both policymakers and diplomatic actors need to monitor and understand China's demographic-diplomacy shifts. Based upon an analysis of the changing strategic contexts which shape domestic and foreign policies, amidst unprecedented demographic shifts, this presentation would attempt to explore the complex interaction between China's demographic dynamics, domestic policy, and international diplomacy.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
