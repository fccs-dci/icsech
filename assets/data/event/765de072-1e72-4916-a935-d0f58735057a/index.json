Many democratic and liberal thinkers understand them and try to correct them from within. The speaker however argues that such revisions are fundamentally inadequate to address the problems. A sounder political arrangement could emerge from conceptualising a hybrid regime that contains both democratic and meritocratic elements, which is what a Confucian would propose. The speaker illustrates the basic arrangements of such a regime, and argues why it can not only deal with the extant problems but also why it is superior to contemporary democratic regimes.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
