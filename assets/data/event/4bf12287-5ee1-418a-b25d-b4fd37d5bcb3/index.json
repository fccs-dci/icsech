There followed a three-year struggle for control of the aircraft on the ground, in the courts and among ministers and diplomats on three continents.</p>\n\n<p>In this seminar Malcolm Merry, author of the recently published Grounded at Kai Tak, Chinese Aircraft Impounded in Hong Kong 1949-1952 (HKUP), will outline the story of the struggle. It is a saga of colourful characters, political intrigue, legal manoeuverings and unexpected turns which strained the UK’s relations with the authorities in the US, Hong Kong and China. The British government insisted that ownership of the planes was purely a question of law but encountered resistance from the colony’s governor, its judges, the Americans and the new regime in China. The fate of the planes became entangled with international post-war tensions and domestic American politics which inevitably meant that the struggle was far more than a simple legal contest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Speaker</strong>:<br />\nMalcolm Merry spent more than 40 years in Hong Kong as a practising barrister, author, lecturer/senior lecturer and associate/adjunct professor at the University of Hong Kong. He is known for his writing on land law but more recently has developed an interest in and published works on Hong Kong’s legal history including two books with HKUP, The Unruly New Territories (2020) and Grounded at Kai Tak (2022).</p>\n\n<p><b>CPD credit is available upon application and subject to accreditation by the Law Society of Hong Kong (currently pending).</b></p>\n\n<p>Register&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cloud.itsc.cuhk.edu.hk/webform/view.php?id=13660756\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;by 5pm, 9&nbsp;February 2023&nbsp;to attend the seminar.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
