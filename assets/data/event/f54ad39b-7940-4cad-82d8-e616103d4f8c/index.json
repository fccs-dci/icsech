The 'two sessions' or&nbsp;<em>lianghui,</em>&nbsp;as they are widely known, assessed the work reports, deliberated on policy documents, and endorsed the new development policy agenda formulated in the newly constituted 14th NPC and 14th CPPCC. But the most important landmark was the ushering in of Xi Jinping’s third tenure as the state president after the nod for his third term as the Party general secretary was given at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022. This discussion will attempt to parse the&nbsp;<em>two sessions,</em>&nbsp;and also analyze some of the developments vis-a-vis institutional reforms, governance, foreign policy, and leadership reshuffle at the government level.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
