The overall process is seen as progressing from extensive to intensive development; and as successively broadening in scope from economic to political, socio-cultural, and security cooperation. Finally, BRI will be situated in the context of China’s “major power diplomacy” and “great struggle” to realize “a great dream.”</span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
