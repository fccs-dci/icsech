Simultaneously,&nbsp;American policymakers must play a larger role in supporting Taiwan. Beyond aiding Taiwan’s military capability, the United States will need to strengthen Taiwan’s economic competitiveness, international participation, and confidence to ensure it remains a democratic polity in Asia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonnie S. Glaser</strong>&nbsp;is the managing director of the German Marshall Fund’s Indo-Pacific Program. She is also a nonresident fellow with the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, and a senior associate with the Pacific Forum. Glaser holds a B.A. from Boston University and M.A. from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Her published works have appeared in&nbsp;Foreign Affairs, The New York Times, and Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n<p>This event is made possible by the generous support of the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
