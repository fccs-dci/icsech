While interweaving the most known diplomatic efforts at the official level with the much unknown intellectual interactions at the people-to-people level, this approach allows an analysis of how the two empires created frameworks for understanding “Self and Other” from both Sino-centric and Anglo-centric points of departure, telling stories that have been understudied in the grand narratives, and reflecting on their implications on today’s bilateral relations.</p>\n\n<p>The event also marks the opening of the new China Culture Gallery at the Manchester Museum, where various narratives on historical Anglo-Chinese encounters will also be exhibited.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Speakers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Xin Liu<strong>&nbsp;</strong>graduated with two BA degrees from China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing and a MBA in Change Management from the University of Central Lancashire in 2002.
