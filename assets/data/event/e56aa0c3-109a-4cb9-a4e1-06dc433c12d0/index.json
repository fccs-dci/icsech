Speakers with extensive clinical and research experience across the Chinese and Western cultures will discuss a range of topics pertaining to ‘inner revolutions’ and the current ‘psycho-fever’ in China: the relational intricacies of clinical encounters, the modern dilemmas of balancing collectivist values with Western influences, the rapidly changing role of technology in shaping personal connections and mental health services, and above all: the evolving nature of family and romantic relationships.</p>"}}},"context":{}}
