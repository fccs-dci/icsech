What happens when students studying in the West encounter racism? Based on an experiment among hundreds of Chinese first-year undergraduates in the United States, we show that seeing racist, anti-Chinese rhetoric interferes with the transfer of democratic values. Chinese students who study in the United States are more predisposed to favor liberal democracy than their peers in China. However, anti-Chinese racism significantly reduces their belief that political reform is desirable for China and increases their support for authoritarian rule. These effects are most pronounced among students who are more likely to reject Chinese nationalism.Encountering non-racist criticisms of the Chinese government does not increase support for authoritarianism.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
