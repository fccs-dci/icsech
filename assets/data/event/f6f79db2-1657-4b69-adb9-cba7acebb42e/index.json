Though the current North Korean provocation has been in response to a large-scale US-ROK joint military exercise, the security situation has been simmering over the last year, particularly after the political change in South Korea in May 2022. Recent events reflect a complete breakdown of the peace processes that were set in motion in 2018. Unlike the previous instances of volatility, the heightened regional security tension in East Asia with the intensifying strategic rivalry between the US and China makes the current situation on the Korean Peninsula alarming. Taking account of the events unfolding in the Korean Peninsula, the seminar aims to evaluate the recent developments on the Korean Peninsula and their implications for East Asia.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
