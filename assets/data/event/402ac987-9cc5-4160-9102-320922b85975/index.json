Extensive literature on nationalism in contemporary China has generally concentrated on its manifestations in relation to Japan, the United States, or the “West” in general. While this is understandable given the prominence of former imperialist powers as foils for China’s contemporary state-sanctioned national identity, it has left a dearth of accounts of Chinese nationalism in relation to its Southeast Asian neighbors. This talk will analyse original 2013 survey data on urban residents’ perceptions of the South China Sea dispute, internet search activity data stretching back to 2006, and quasi-ethnographic observation of online discourse. The analysis shows, first, that Beijing’s more confrontational policy in the South China Sea was a key cause of intensified Chinese public sentiments on the issue. This largely unintended effect generated significant new challenges to the party-state’s control of public opinion. The case shows how the Internet reduced the CCP propaganda state’s ability to frame domestic interpretations of foreign policy developments, but retains decisive agenda-setting influence over the issue’s salience. These findings provide theoretical insight into the causes of nationalism and the socio-political consequences of network technology under authoritarian regimes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Speaker</strong></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Chubb is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion.
