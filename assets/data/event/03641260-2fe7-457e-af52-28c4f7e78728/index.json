Between 2008 and 2019, Zhang frequently visited China, his homeland, to photograph the changing social and physical landscape. He says:</p>\n\n<p>“Every time I return to China (whether on specific topics or not), I become increasingly aware of the passage of time between visits and my inability to keep pace with the country. It has been a human impulse to collect images like souvenirs as a reminder of the experience. Yet, the documentary images serve as a perfect metaphor from the fragmentary nature of memory and the desire to take ownership of it.”</p>\n\n<p>Zhang’s work with India China Institute establishes the continuity between disjointed experiences by bringing individual lives in China to the forefront of contextual discourse. This digital archive closely examines life in a society that is in a perpetual state of flux. In addition, Zhang will share his thoughts on the process of archiving and what it means to make archival material accessible to the public.</p>\n\n<p>As Dr. Roland Benoit, a German neuroscientist once said, “Our memory is not made for the past, but for the future.” So is the project – BEING.</p>\n\n<p>You can join this event by&nbsp;registering to attend in-person, or by registering to receive the Zoom/Livestream link.
