CEAS Author Talks series, this event features University of Chicago Professor, Judith Farquhar, and her book, &quot;A Way of Life: Things, Thought, and Action in Chinese Medicine,&quot; which offers a philosophical introduction to Chinese traditional medicine. Reflection on the things recognized by Chinese medicine presents fresh problems in ontology. A reading of scholarly writing and thought in the field proposes a challenging epistemology. And a view of Chinese medical action through a pragmatic lens suggests that there is no thing or thought outside of practical imperatives. This program also features University of Chicago&#039;s P. Sean Brotherton as Discussant.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
