Why? One explanation posits a process of collective killings focused on rural households categorized as class enemies by the regime. This view draws parallels with genocidal intergroup violence in Bosnia, Rwanda, and similar settings. New evidence from classified investigations conducted in China in the 1980s reveals the extent to which the killings were part of a province-wide counter-insurgency campaign carried out by village militia. The unusually high death tolls were generated by an organized effort that resembled the massacres of communists and other leftists coordinated by Indonesia’s army in 1965.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Andrew G. Walder&nbsp;</strong>is the Denise O’Leary and Kent Thiry Professor in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University, where he is also a Senior Fellow in the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.
