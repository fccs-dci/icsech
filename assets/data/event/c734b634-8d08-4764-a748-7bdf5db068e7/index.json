Since coming to power in 2014, the Modi government has compromised the integrity and independence of state institutions, and attacked civil society actors, media, academia, and opposition parties. Yet the Indian case is not unique in an era of democratic decline, as elected leaders have tapped deeply felt resentments, harnessed new coalitions, and created popular narratives that legitimize the concentration of power in single parties and individuals. Through a comparative discussion of India, Turkey, and Eastern Europe, this panel will explore how to understand this authoritarian turn, varying modes of repressive governance within democracies and bases of its support, and the channels through which opposition parties and social movements navigate and resist a fraught political landscape.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
