In particular, the upcoming 20th Party Congress appears likely to assert a continued role for Xi Jinping as head of the party leadership, overturning prior practice and further cementing an apparent personalist turn in the party. At a time of significant apparent changes, what can we observe in terms of ongoing continuities? Are we truly seeing a major break with the past or does the past still have much to teach us about what is happening and what is to come? Please join us as we engage in a&nbsp;conversation&nbsp;with three expert commentators on the Chinese Communist Party – Diana Fu, Ian Jonson and&nbsp;Jeff Wasserstrom&nbsp;– exploring what yesterday may have to tell us about tomorrow.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
