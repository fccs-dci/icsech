China, too, is facing economic uncertainties, even as growth is expected to markedly increase this year. Amid these difficulties, China-LAC deal-making continues more or less apace, however—often related to the shifting economic realities brought about by climate change and energy transformation.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, May 24, 9:00-10:00 AM EDT, join the&nbsp;Boston University Global Development Policy Center and the Inter-American Dialogue&nbsp;for a virtual discussion of China's evolving economic relations with LAC, featuring new findings and data. What trends were evident in China-LAC economic engagement in 2022? How are China-LAC trade, investment, development finance, debt, and diplomacy evolving amid shifting economic demands and new policy agendas? And what are the prospects for future China-LAC engagement across economic sectors?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
