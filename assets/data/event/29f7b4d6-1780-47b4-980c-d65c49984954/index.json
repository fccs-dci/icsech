Book reviews are helpful, but take months or even years to come out. To make it easier for China scholars to discuss with each other some of the recent English-language books they are reading, the University of Washington China Studies Program is starting a virtual China Studies Book Club. We think it will be fun to have conversations about books we find exciting, provocative, or moving and invite China scholars elsewhere to join us.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
