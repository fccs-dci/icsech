I will then give a broader overview of the socialist media ecology from the 1960s to the 1970s that takes into account technological, infrastructural, political and cultural transformations, especially the expansion of wired broadcasting, transistor radio sets, and commune-based movie teams in the countryside. In particular, this talk focuses on the grassroots reception of radio and film that crossed national borders from both “socialist” and “capitalist” camps to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the cacophony, complexity, and cosmopolitanism of the mediascape, soundscape, and mindscape of the Cultural Revolution decade.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
