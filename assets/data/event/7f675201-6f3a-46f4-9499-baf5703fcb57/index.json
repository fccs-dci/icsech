These narratives impart numerous perspectives on the notion of connections, journey and migration as ideological and intellectual pursuits in the Asian context. The documents describe the unstable social and political environment and provide an account of both the human and governmental enterprises. The narratives, describing cultural and linguistic experiences, espionage, different eye-witness and archival account of communist revolutions, disillusionment with socialist China reveal an empirical discourse. By examining the narratives and archival works, the seminar examines the connection between personal and collective memories which become a means to substantiate the knowledge about the past and their understanding of the present.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
