Research into the BRI often treats the Chinese state as a monolith and focuses on the initiative’s external manifestations, such as non-binding agreements signed between the Chinese and other governments. Our speakers, Professor Maria Adele Carrai of NYU Shanghai and Hong Zhang, a fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, have analyzed policy documents issued by China’s provincial governments in response to BRI. They will demonstrate how subnational governments re-interpret the BRI and interweave it with existing or new initiatives of their own to generate a new international economic agenda largely driven by regional interests. Their analysis underscores how China’s approach to governance as an authoritarian developmental state differs from the legalistic approach of regulatory states, as it relies on administrative directives for mobilization. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The speakers will also introduce two new tools that map China’s overseas economic engagements. The first tool uses satellite images over time to demonstrate the changes brought forward by hundreds of Chinese projects on the ground. The second tool, called “People’s Map of Global China,” is a collective effort by academics and civil society organizations worldwide to document Chinese projects and their local impacts.</p>\n\n<p><i>About the speakers</i></p>\n\n<p><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mariadelecarrai.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648660778291000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2UkVaIyW0_aOdbA3jP12hE\" href=\"https://www.mariadelecarrai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Adele Carrai</a> is an assistant professor of Global China Studies at NYU Shanghai. Her research explores the history of international law in East Asia and investigates how China’s rise as a global power is shaping norms and redefining the international distribution of power. In light of the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, she is looking in particular at the economic, legal, and political repercussions of Chinese investments and economic engagement in Europe and Africa. Prior to joining NYU Shanghai, she was a recipient of a three-year Marie-Curie fellowship at KU Leuven. She also has been a fellow at the Italian Academy of Columbia University, Princeton-Harvard China and the World Program, the Max Weber Program of the European University Institute of Florence, and New York University Law School.</p>\n\n<p><a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://madeinchinajournal.com/author/hong-zhang/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648660778291000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0c62FEecVnuevXELa1ypGS\" href=\"https://madeinchinajournal.com/author/hong-zhang/\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Zhang (Stella Hong)</a> is a postdoctoral fellow at the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, and a fellow at the Columbia-Harvard China and the World Program.
