The initiative involves forging vital linkages between South-East Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes. BRI has proved beneficial for China leading to expanded markets, heightened trade opportunities, regional development, particularly in the Western regions such as Xinjiang, and an increased array of investment prospects. However, for other nations, it has prompted concerns, including the possibility of falling into debt traps and the displacement of job opportunities. From its inception, the prevailing view in India, as articulated by both the academic and strategic communities, as well as government entities, has been that the BRI is less an economic development initiative and more of a geopolitical and strategic endeavour. One of the most significant concerns for India, in this regard, pertains to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a crucial component of the BRI, which traverses through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK). This has raised substantial alarm in India as it infringes upon the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. As the Belt and Road Initiative commemorates its 10th anniversary, it is essential to engage in a comprehensive assessment and reflection on the significant impact, implications, and challenges that India encounters in connection with this initiative.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
