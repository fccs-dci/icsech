They will discuss the conflicting claims to water space, resources, and islands and ask whether international law can be invoked to reduce tensions. Why do states from outside the region care about the South China Sea and the disputes there? Are the disputes and challenges in the East and South China Seas linked? What is the role of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and might the United States finally become a party to it? And what is the U.S.-Asia Law Institute doing to try to move the region toward a more peaceful dynamic?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
