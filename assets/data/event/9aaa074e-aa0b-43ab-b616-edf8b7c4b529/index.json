But after decades of prioritizing rapid economic development over environmental conservation, the state-centered approach has shown signs of fatigue. Economic growth is self-limited if the environment collapses. In 2015, the government gave private actors a new role in environmental law enforcement by giving civil society organizations the legal standing to sue polluters in the public interest.
