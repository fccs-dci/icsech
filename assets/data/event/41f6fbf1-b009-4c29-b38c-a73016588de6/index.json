China's stance appears to be shaped by several factors, including a perceived need to counter the United States and therefore a desire to support Russia while minimizing the costs of doing so to Chinese interests. China's desire for internal political stability and the increasingly personalist nature of its regime and political system also appear to have shaped its decision-making, as has its evolving assessments of what the Ukraine conflict might mean for Taiwan.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
