He was also involved with activities related to international co-operation and has represented and led Indian delegations to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. His research interests at IIMB included technology and competitive advantage, national technology priorities and national technology policy, studies on innovation, telecommunications in the Indian context, national innovation systems, modelling complex systems and national security issues. His current work at NIAS covers the missile, nuclear weapons, and space domains. These include war and deterrence strategies, space weapons and space war with a special focus on China. He has also been involved with other colleagues on a number of studies on Chinese strategies relating to hi tech areas such as single crystal blade technology used in aero-engines and Rare Earths. Recent work takes a look at what India should do in space as a response to global changes in the world order that increasingly links space assets with conventional and nuclear war. He has just finished a detailed study of China’s A2AD strategy and its implications for war and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific Region. His recent publications include “Space, War, and Security – A Strategy for India”, which has been translated into Chinese and “China’s Space Programme – From the Era of Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping”, published by Springer Nature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chair</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lt.

China’s military prowess has increased rapidly in the past two decades and its pursuit of sophisticated weaponry has necessitated an advancement of its space programme as well. The seminar will focus on China’s space capabilities in the broader context of China’s growing military might. The role of China’s Anti-Access and Area Denial (A2AD) strategy and the vulnerabilities related to spaced based capabilities will be discussed at length. Against the backdrop of China’s grand military strategy, the challenges faced by China in the development of its space programme will also be examined. Satellite coverage on Taiwan; the role of Comprehensive National Power; and the global space power trends are some of the themes that will be explored during the seminar.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
