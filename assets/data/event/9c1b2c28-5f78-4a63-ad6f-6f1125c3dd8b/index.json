A Xinhua joint statement issued in Beijing, where the talks were held, said: “The conclusion of boundary negotiations and the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Bhutan fully serve the long-term and fundamental interests of the country and nation of Bhutan.” The fact that Bhutanese Foreign Minister Lyonpo Tandi Dorji travelled to Beijing for the talks, where he was feted by foreign minister Wang Yi and vice president Han Zheng, are being viewed as moves indicating both sides want a quick border settlement. Unlike in the past, Bhutan’s urgency to quickly normalise relations with China is drawing attention in New Delhi and internationally. While there is no substantive reaction or response to the 25th round of Beijing-Thimphu talks so far, “significant,” “major diplomatic breakthrough,” and “alarm bells ringing” are some reactions coming from media analysts and foreign affairs experts in India, China, and in the global press. The ICS panel discussion aims to assess and critically examine the latest attempt by China and Bhutan to step up border negotiations and “soon” realize a deal to address the border settlement problem.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
