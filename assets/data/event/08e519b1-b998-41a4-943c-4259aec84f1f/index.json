This lecture reports on the on-going research in Chinese innovation models through tracking the evolution of several critical high-tech industrial sectors in state policies, investments, market demands, and technological development. It reveals that Chinese innovation models are diverse across industries and enterprises and fluid over time. I argue that it is important to understand China&#039;s pursuit of technology from its own shifting priorities, strengths, and weaknesses, rather than only through the lens of great power competition.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
