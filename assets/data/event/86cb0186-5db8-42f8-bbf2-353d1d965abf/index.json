Two decades on, the debate is whether China’s outsized global trade dominance reflects merely a failure by the WTO to enforce its rules, or if the regime is fundamentally inadequate to address the challenges posted by China’s massive state-led economy. Professor Petros C. Mavroidis will discuss his new book (co-authored with Andre Sapir), China and the WTO: Why Multilateralism Still Matters. He will explain why China presents the WTO with a unique challenge, and how judicious reforms could save the WTO regime.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
