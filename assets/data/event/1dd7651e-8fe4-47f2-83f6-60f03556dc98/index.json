USALI is part of a wider effort at NYU School of Law to be an international law school and foster scholarly conversation across borders. Pursuing these goals takes constant effort. Technology makes it easier for scholars around the world to read each otherâ€™s work, but we still face the barriers of language, culture, and divergent perspectives. Now as the world is increasingly fractured by geopolitical rivalries, might this ideal recede even further? Our extraordinary panel of discussants with a range of perspectives on international academic exchanges will talk about why scholarly exchanges matter, how we can incentivize them, and what we lose when scholarship becomes parochial, with a focus on the case of Japan-US exchanges.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
