These crisscrossing nets stem from a more intricate “field.” Possessing a spirit of adventure, commercial acumen, and multilingual proficiency, Sogdian merchant caravans played a leading role along the Silk Road during the medieval period. Traversing east and west, they transported silk, gemstones, and spices, and established settlements of varying sizes along the Silk Road. Moreover, they served as crucial mediators connecting Eastern and Western arts, cultures, ideologies, and religions, exerting significant influence on the spread of civilizations in Central and West Asia, South Asia, and East Asia. This lecture takes a detailed image from a Northern Qi sculpture as a key and interprets the identity and life stories of a Sogdian merchant caravan, as well as the Silk Road panorama it reflects.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
