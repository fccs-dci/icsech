The talk attempts to present a critical translation of democracy between Chinese &amp; Western thought. In addition, a relational lens sensitizes the way in which the population &amp; its leaders are related &amp; explains why Confucian leaders care about being benevolent even without a power-limiting autonomous society. Specifically, a comparison of the social contract theory and the analogy of a “natural (or heavenly) contract” is intended to critique the imagined dichotomy between the state &amp; society in libertarian China studies. The critical translation as well as the comparative critique reveals a cyclical view of history that neither romanticizes nor demonizes democracy, authoritarianism, or China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
