It makes fresh explanation of the multi-faceted origins and historical evolution of&nbsp;<i>The Book of Songs</i>&nbsp;in all their aspects. The compilation of&nbsp;<i>The Book of Songs</i>&nbsp;stems from conflict and compromise between Shang and Zhou culture, which experienced a complex and lengthy journey from ritualization to secularization and from standardization to regionalization.<br />\nTaking inspiration from the process of translating from Chinese into Japanese, Professor Yoshinobu Yuki, in addition to introducing how to deal with issues including those of cultural adaption, will also discuss how historically the Japanese have treated Chinese culture and characters, and in the future, how matters of cultural exchange between the Japanese and Chinese could be addressed.<br />\n- Language: Putonghua<br />\n- Venue: SWT 702, Level 7, Shaw Tower, Hong Kong Baptist University<br />\n- Online: ZOOM<br />\nLink:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/96903819508?pwd=bFhSTGF0alM0Z0U0YjRTaHYrYnlDZz09\" target=\"_blank\">https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/96903819508?pwd=bFhSTGF0alM0Z0U0YjRTaHYrYnlDZz09</a><br />\nMeeting ID: 969 0381 9508<br />\nPassword: 973008<br />\n<br />\nThis lecture series is sponsored by Eurasia Foundation (from Asia).
