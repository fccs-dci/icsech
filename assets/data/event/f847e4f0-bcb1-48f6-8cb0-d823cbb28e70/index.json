Both sides agreed to reopen their embassies and exchange ambassadors after seven years of tensions, mutual animosity, proxy warfare, suspected attacks and espionage between the two countries. The deal has created ripples across the globe. This landmark agreement has the potential to transform the Middle East politics by realigning its major powers, replacing the current Arab-Iranian divide with a complex web of relationships, and weaving the region into China’s global ambitions. The fact that the deal was facilitated by China is being seen as another sign that China’s diplomatic clout in the region as well as across the globe is growing. How sustainable would it be, how would the other regional players respond and what would be the impact on the traditional US dominance in this region, are some of the questions that this conversation would seek to explore.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
