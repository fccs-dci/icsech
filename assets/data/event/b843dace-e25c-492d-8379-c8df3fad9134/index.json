It is about to complete its fifth research station in Antarctica. All this makes China a major actor in determining the future of the high seas – waters outside of national jurisdiction. Professor Liu Nengye of Singapore Management University will explain China’s views on high seas governance, starting with its stance during negotiations for the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the more recent treaty on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction. Professor Liu believes that achieving sustainability is an essential pillar of China’s approach to high seas governance.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
