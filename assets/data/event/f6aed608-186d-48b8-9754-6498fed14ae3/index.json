This is evident especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, trade war, plunging exports and overwhelming pressures causing weak recovery. As a result, in a downturn, the state planners resort to various tools to control the crisis. Handling a bout of economic weakness has not remained as simple as it used to be in the past. The leadership and the planners are preparing to mitigate traditional and newer forms of challenges. China has been speeding up spending on infrastructure, taking more neutral steps towards income taxes and relaxing some restraints on bank lending. These directions look more evident than in the past. Cleaning up the financial system, stabilising growth and deleveraging are key measures China is adopting to manage its domestic economic governance. At the same time, China also explores to continue the generous, supportive economic policies to stimulate growth from below. It would be interesting to watch how well China is equipped to manage such stress and work around its domestic economic governance. </span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
