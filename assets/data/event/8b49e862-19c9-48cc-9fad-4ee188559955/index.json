The mainstream of traditional economics mainly discusses the material production and industrial structure of human society, as well as the industrial capital behind it; the IT revolution, together with the intelligent economy and the digital economy from the 1970s demands that economics explore and analyze the structure and mechanism of science-and-technological capital. The lecture focuses on comparing the commonalties and differences of industrial capital, financial capital and science-and-technological capital, and strives to explain how the modus operandi of science-and-technological capitalism dominates and affects the economic transformation of developed countries, and profoundly changes the fundamental structure of globalisation into the 2020s.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
