It was especially aimed at completely altering the conditions of women (urban “housewives”).</p>\n<p>By looking at both the theoretical discussions and the experimental practices of collectivization in Beijing, this paper shows that while the movement failed, it nonetheless brought to the fore some of the crucial tensions that marred the search for socialist living: between welfare and development, between labor and liberation, and between production and social reproduction.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
