Among these, the three major global infectious diseases that stand out for their unique characteristics and lasting impact are the influenza pandemic, SARS, and COVID-19. The speaker will delve into these diseases from the perspective of Chinese medicine, a viewpoint often neglected by previous researchers, examining how traditional medicine defines and treats these ailments. COVID-19 has arguably made the most profound impact on the general public, and the speaker will highlight key publications that resonate with the pandemic’s history. Furthermore, in discussion with medical historians, the speaker will reassess the state of research and education in Chinese medical history pre- and post-pandemic. Emphasizing public history, a conversation will be initiated on educational practices and public discourse regarding the history of diseases. By simultaneously focusing on research and the dissemination of scientific knowledge, the aim is to enhance the understanding and impact of disease within the history of science.</p>\n\n<p>Registration:<a href=\"https://forms.office.com/r/c8RhtpYVPX\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;https://forms.office.com/r/c8RhtpYVPX</a><br />\n<br />\nIn-person Venue: Level 7, Shaw Tower, Shaw Campus, HKBU<br />\nOnline：ZOOM:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/92227978675?pwd=ZzBzenlFek9vbE5LdXRmQ20vT3hpUT09\" target=\"_blank\">https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/92227978675?pwd=ZzBzenlFek9vbE5LdXRmQ20vT3hpUT09</a><br />\nMeeting ID: 922 2797 8675<br />\nPassword: 659232<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
