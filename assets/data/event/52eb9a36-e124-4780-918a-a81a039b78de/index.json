Moreover, the world’s leading sovereign wealth funds are mostly established in commodity-exporting countries for stabilization or savings purposes, what does China, a major commodity importer, establish and use its sovereign wealth funds for? With the global expansion of China’s sovereign funds since the Global Financial Crisis, what are the implications for the role of the Chinese state in the global financial system? By systematically analysing the evolution of China’s sovereign funds complex, this talk answers these questions and illustrates how the Chinese state has leveraged both political and financial resources to establish a global network of Chinese sovereign ‘leveraged’ funds and advanced state-prioritized agenda at home and abroad.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
