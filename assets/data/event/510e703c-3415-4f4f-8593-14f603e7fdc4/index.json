Bringing literary representations of the residency by Chinese writers into a productive dialogue with field research and historical analysis, the talk will show that translation functioned as a tool for not only literary exchange but also cultural diplomacy in the tumultuous “first encounters” between Chinese literature and world literature on the platforms provided by IWP.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
