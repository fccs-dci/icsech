To bridge this gap in the literature, Professor Lei develops a theoretical framework to analyze global scientific controversies surrounding research in China. Empirically, her talk will discuss the human genome editing controversy surrounding research conducted by scientists in China between 2015 and 2019. It shows how elite scientists negotiated expert– public relationships within and across the national and transnational expert spheres, how unexpected disruption at the nexus of the four spheres disrupted expert–public relationships as envisioned by elite experts, and how the Chinese state intervened to redraw the boundary between openness and secrecy at both national and transnational levels.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
