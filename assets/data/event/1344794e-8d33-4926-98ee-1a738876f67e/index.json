Daughter of a Beiyang reformer, wife of a Nationalist official educated at MIT, mother of an underground Communist revolutionary, she herself left no direct trace in the public record. She emerges primarily in interviews with her son, and in an unfinished and unpublished historical novel by her daughter. Filial love, household management, sexual propriety, wifely duty, maternal loyalty, domestic cosmopolitanism, and shrewd political judgment mingle in her story, raising questions about where revolution lies and how we should track its less visible effects. Her life illuminates the gendered effects of China’s long revolution, the central importance of women as symbols of the nation, and the limits of what we can know about the past.</p>\n\n<p>Speaker:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gail Hershatter</strong>, Research Professor and Distinguished Professor Emer. of History at the University of California, Santa Cruz.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Professor Hershatter is a former President of the Association for Asian Studies.

The Modern China field has been forced to reckon with the possibility that access to PRC sources may soon become exceptional, and that its foreclosure portends a post-archival future. What is history without archive, or archive without history? The purpose of this four-part series is to explore promising responses by several scholars to this crisis in the archive, both as a means of illuminating new methodological directions in PRC history as well as reexamining perennial historical questions from a new aspect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The next two events in this series are:</p>\n\n<h6>Wed.
