Her primary research interests include Chinese women's and gender history, the history of the Chinese family and marriage, and late imperial social and cultural history. Her first book,&nbsp;<em>True to Her Word: The Faithful Maiden Cult in Late Imperial China</em>, explores the intellectual controversy and family conflict that surrounded the faithful maidens, and the beliefs, mentality, and lived experiences of these women. Recently, she guest-edited a special issue on China for the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the History of Sexuality</em>&nbsp;(2013).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW\">Guotong Li (Professor, Department of History, California State University Long Beach)</span></p>\n\n<p>Dr. Li’s current research interests focus on gender and family in maritime Asia during the encounters between the Muslim diaspora and Chinese merchants before European hegemony. She has published two monographs, entitled&nbsp;<em>Migrating Fujianese: Ethnic, Family, and Gender Identities in an Early Modern Maritime World&nbsp;</em>(Brill, 2016) and&nbsp;<em>In Quest of Immortality: Women’s Education in Late Imperial China, 1368-1911&nbsp;</em>(Guangxi Normal University Press, 2014) respectively. She is completing her new book project on a Chinese Muslim community in late imperial Quanzhou, the world’s largest seaport under the Mongol empire. This project was sponsored by a Luce/ACLS fellowship (2015-2016), aiming to bring a more global perspective on local histories and to enrich global maritime history with the human agency of gender and ethnicity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW\">Yulian Wu (Associate Professor, Department of History, Michigan State University)</span></p>\n\n<p>Professor Wu's research examines the relationship between ethnic policies, material culture, and gender relations in the High Qing period (1680-1820). Her work asks how the Manchu court, the minority rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), implemented ethnic policies by constructing a material world and how men and women’s lives were influenced and transformed by the changing material culture.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
