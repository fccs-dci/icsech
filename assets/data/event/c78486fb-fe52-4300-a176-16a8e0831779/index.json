They are especially suspicious of Chinese firms being utilized as tools to promote Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence in ways that undermine the “rules-based” democratic order. My presentation will demonstrate that the influence of the CCP over Chinese business corporations is surprisingly limited, due to the complex and fragmentary structure of the Chinese political ecosystem. Rather than viewing Chinese corporations as subservient tools of a CCP-led authoritarian hierarchy, we should recognize their capacity to act as autonomous agents within the fragmented corporate-political ecosystem – frequently pursuing their own interests in ways that subvert Communist Party policies. This revised understanding should foster a more nuanced and effective engagement between “Western” nations and the Chinese government.</p>\n\n<p><em>The ANU China Seminar Series is supported by the Australian Centre on China in the World at ANU College of Asia and the Pacific.</em></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
