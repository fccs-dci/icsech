Nepal also has the unenviable position of balancing its relations with India, China and the US, amidst tense US-China and India-China relations. Externally, the situation has been aggravated by the pandemic and the global economic slowdown. Internally, governmental instability and the politicization of foreign policy have further hindered Nepal’s external engagements. This seminar will examine facets of China’s presence in Nepal, Nepal’s options to navigate the context of a difficult regional global environment and achieve its developmental goals, as well as implications for India of the increasing camaraderie between its two neighbours.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
