Reorienting the country&#039;s military posture remains a crucial aspect of deterring future Chinese aggression along the border. Though the past few decades have seen various CBMs &amp; border agreements holding the peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), events like the Galwan Clash reflect the inadequacy of past agreements, &amp; the urgent need to bolster India&#039;s conventional deterrence against China&#039;s military.<br />\nWhat are the immediate doctrinal changes &amp; modernisation India needs to take, to counter the Chinese threat? What aspects of China&#039;s military should worry India&#039;s security establishment the most? Will the LAC now be an &#039;active&#039; border, as the Line of Control is with Pakistan? How can India rebuild CBMs &amp; ensure credible deterrence against China? How should the Army &amp; Air Force work together to ensure a military edge along the LAC?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
