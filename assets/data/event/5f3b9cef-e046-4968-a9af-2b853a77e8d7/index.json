The year 2019 saw the curtain rise on a U.S.–China bipolar rivalry quite different from the Cold War&#039;s U.S.–Soviet Union bipolarity. The fundamental difference between the current bipolar rivalry and that during the Cold War is that ideology is no longer the main engine driving international competition, but rather a new digital dimension of strategic competition is emerging between the United States and China. The event will be moderated by Aditi Kumar, the Executive Director of the Belfer Center.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
