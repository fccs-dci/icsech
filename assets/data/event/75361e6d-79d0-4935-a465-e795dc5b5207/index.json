Join us for a live-streamed \"slice of life\" experience with local Beijinger, Fred He, as he heads out into the busy Beijing streets to a local market. Tricycles pulling food carts flank the sidewalks selling delicious breakfast staples such as 油条 (yóutiáo, a fried dough), 包子 (bāozi, steamed buns), and 煎饼 (jiānbĭng, egg pancakes) to busy commuters. An unassuming doorway that could easily be missed yields an expansive wet market selling fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and myriad spices – all at a fraction of the price of the nearby supermarkets. QR codes hang from every seller, no matter how small the business – cash and cards are a thing of the past in the Middle Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Join us on June 1st, 8:00PM-9:00 PM ET as USHCA and WildChina host a live virtual Beijing street food market tour to see where hungry Beijing commuters find breakfast in the capital! This will be the second segment of our Eat, Drink, &amp; Prosper Together! series, where we foster understanding through cuisine and culture with our partners and friends.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
