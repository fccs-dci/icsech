It also looks at specific themes - technology, agricultural development, reform of state-owned enterprises and the use of Party bodies to engage in foreign propaganda work among other issues to offer examples of the merging of Chinese domestic political and foreign policy interests. In the process, the volume offers its readers a better idea of China&#039;s place in the world as the Chinese themselves see it and the implications over time for China, its neighbourhood and the wider world. The book uniquely has an all Asian cast of experts on Chinese domestic, foreign and security policies.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
