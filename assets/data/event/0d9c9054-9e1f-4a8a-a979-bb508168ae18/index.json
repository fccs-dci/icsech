Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there have been many accusations of the PRC media of one-sided coverage of the war, using the situation in their own interests. Considering the sizable readership of Sinophone media worldwide, it is essential to have a good understanding of the messages on the war that are being spread through various outlets from Greater China.</p>\n\n<p>The key questions we are going to discuss with Ukrainian and International experts:<br />\n— What are the moral problems in the Sinophone coverage of the conflict? Is it possible to speak about the violation of the norms of journalistic ethics?<br />\n— Are there any significant discrepancies between state-owned and privately-owned media?<br />\n— How does the vocabulary employed in the coverage of the war in Ukraine reflect the underlying political agendas and biases?<br />\n— Are there any significant differences in the state media coverage of the conflict depending on whether they target domestic or international audiences?<br />\n— What are the procedures for fact checking and source finding involved in the reporting on Ukraine in Sinophone media?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
