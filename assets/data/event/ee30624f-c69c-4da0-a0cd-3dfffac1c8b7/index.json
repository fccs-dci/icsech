The anti-government protesters in Sri Lanka have rallied against a downward spiralling economy that has exhausted Sri Lankan foreign reserves. In the form of infrastructure loans, the Chinese economic footprint in the country has aided the lopsided economic reforms in draining the public finances. In addition to the economic downfall, the political instability in the country has not allowed the situation to improve either. Even as Ranil Wickremesinghe took oath as the new Prime Minister of Sri Lanka the people are still demanding the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Sri Lankans are not hopeful of Wickremesinghe to be able to reverse the economic mismanagement by successive governments over the last few years. Amid another humanitarian crisis in India’s neighbourhood, the country is trying to put in serious efforts to aid political stability and economic recovery. The fluid situation of Sri Lanka will be discussed along with responses by India and China as their assistance can lead to setting a precedent for the future role the two countries will play in South Asian geopolitics.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
