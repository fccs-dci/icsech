My research leverages game theory, computerized text analysis, archival research, and survey-experimental methods to provide empirical traction on questions about how states use legal and foreign policy instruments to get what they want in the technology space. I am broadly interested in security studies, strategic competition, and cyber conflict. At present, I hold concurrent postdoctoral appointments with the Tufts Fletcher Cybersecurity Program, the Harvard Belfer Center, and the Harvard-Columbia China and the World Program. My research on the law and politics of militarily impactful technologies has been supported by the Fulbright Program, the National Science Foundation, the US Department of State (Title VIII), the Department of Education (FLAS), and other major sources.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
