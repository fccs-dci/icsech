Few people trusted political leaders or regimes’ ideologies. Large, little-changed bureaucracies were unable to cope with growing pressure for social and economic improvement. By the late 1980s, widespread protests shook political systems across the region, leading to a period of steady, inconsistent political changes and reform attempts across the region.<br />\n<br />\nThirty years after the first elections following the end of the Warsaw Pact, what can countries in Asia learn from the governing challenges and development of new political institutions in Eastern Europe? This webinar brings experts on Eastern European politics to discuss causes of political turmoil in the 1980s, the challenges of reforming Eastern Europe’s political structures, and why Eastern European countries experienced varied outcomes in their institutional development. Through this analysis, panelists will comment on lessons for East Asia to learn from Eastern Europe’s political changes.</p>\n\n<p>This event is the first part of a two-part series of panels.
