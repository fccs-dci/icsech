Most developers rely on high-interest loans, and must repay their creditors as quick as possible to keep the chain of funding intact, reduce risk, and secure profits. Thus, little bees are pushed to sell quicker, rather than to sell more units. Due to this hyper-financialization, time on the market becomes a key management target. The little bees aim to convert random encounters on the street into meaningful business relationships. This conversion is facilitated by maps, numbers and speculative culture. Moreover, the demands on sales time are exploitative because in the Chinese real estate market there is a discrepancy between agency and responsibility: Even though little bees’ daily movements are beyond their control, they shoulder immense responsibility, suffer from physical and psychological stress, and are fired at little cost to management. Analyzing this entanglement with time and financialization provides critical insight into urban precariousness in China.</p>\n\n<p>Yang Zhan is an Assistant Professor of Cultural Anthropology in the Department of Applied Social Sciences at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
