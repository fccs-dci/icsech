This aggressive phase began in April 2013, in the Daulat Beg Oldi sector. The following year, violence broke out again in September 2014 near the border village of Demchok. After about three weeks, both sides agreed to withdraw troops. The next serious incident occurred in mid-June 2017, when Chinese road construction crews, escorted by border guards, intruded into the Doklam bowl, disputed between China and Bhutan. Hundreds of Indian troops in the vicinity, acting in accordance with New Delhi’s foreign policy coordination treaty with Thimphu, crossed into Doklam from Sikkim and physically blocked Chinese border guards. The face-off that ensued was resolved only after 73 days when both sides agreed to disengage troops.</p>\n\n<p>In the latest and ongoing standoff, in the spring of 2020 after India cut back on patrolling the Ladakh border because of the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of PLA troops crossed the LAC and occupied Indian-claimed territory. In diplomatic and military talks between the two sides, the Chinese ascribed their crossing of the LAC to India’s drive to build border infrastructure, and also to New Delhi’s political changes in 2019 in the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Three years on, the PLA’s intrusions into six areas in Eastern Ladakh – Depsang, Galwan, PP-15, Gogra-Hot Spring, Pangong North Bank and Pangong South Bank – have added a new dimension to the management of the Sino-India border. The casualties on both sides have brought down the curtains on the hard-won peace that was supported with five border agreements. India would have to henceforth take nothing for granted.</p>\n\n<p>This talk would focus on the following questions: Are there any lessons to be learned from this decade of uncertain peace? Why does China appear to be focusing on Ladakh, rather than Arunachal Pradesh? How long can the current state of affairs persist if India continues to push for status quo ante? What do the past three years of negotiations with China tell us about what should be our hopes and achievements and should we think in terms of an honourable exit? Finally, instead of discernible progress towards peace in Gogra, Galwan, Pangong and Demchok, are we headed back towards 1959?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
