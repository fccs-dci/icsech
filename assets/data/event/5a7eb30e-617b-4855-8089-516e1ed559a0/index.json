After all, China begins English language instruction universally in elementary school, and it is widely held that the country with the greater skill in the language of the interlocutor holds the upper hand. The U.S. Department of Education has thus long promoted Foreign Language and Area Studies through direct aid to students and programs. For the past two decades, the DOD has been pushing schools to teach foreign language more effectively as well as extensively by using six cutting edge STARTALK pedagogical principles. These focus on standards and themes, learner activities, comprehensible input, integrating language with culture and content, authentic materials, and performance-based assessment. This session will discuss the challenges and opportunities posed by such evolving dynamics in the field, and the effect of these on classroom teachers and the learning experiences they construct for students.</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,serif\"><strong>Jacob ALGRIM</strong> </span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Garamond&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">is a lecturer of Chinese and a Ph.D. student in EALL.
