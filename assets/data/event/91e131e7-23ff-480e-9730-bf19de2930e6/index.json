What fascinating stories do these mutual interactions yield? This conference seeks to bring together scholars to metaphorically “map” the territory that encompasses the relationship between religion and place across Asia. We will investigate how spaces and places, either real or imagined, contribute to contemplative, ritualistic, artistic, or ethical aspects of life within religious traditions, texts, and activities throughout Asia.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
