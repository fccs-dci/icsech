A collaborative effort, this study brings to the fore voices of Indian, Zambian and Chinese scholars and experts based at multiple institutions across geographies. In this discussion, the principal authors of this monograph will share key findings from their chapters written after extensive fieldwork. From providing an overview of China-Zambia economic relations, speakers will also throw light on the diversity in China-Zambia agricultural cooperation, dynamics of skills transfer in agriculture, a case study of a Chinese firm using Artificial Intelligence in agriculture while also discussing larger China-Zambia socio-political challenges including the issue of mounting debt, growing negative perception of the Chinese, a growing Chinese diaspora in Zambia among others.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
