The stereotypical Chinese foreign affairs official — faceless, formal and utterly predictable — is being replaced by the &quot;wolf-warrior diplomat&quot; — colorful, idiosyncratic and aggressively controversial. U.S. and Chinese diplomats are now likely to confront each other both in the corridors of power and on news shows and Twitter. Meanwhile, Hollywood and American entertainment companies are forming ongoing partnerships built on dreams of a lucrative pan-Pacific cultural market. We must wonder: In addition to becoming an economic superpower and a rising military superpower, will China become a soft power superpower? Relatedly, how successful have America and China been in recent years at presenting themselves to the world? What does the rest of the world think of these two superpowers?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
