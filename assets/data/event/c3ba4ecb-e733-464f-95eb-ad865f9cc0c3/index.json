The research reveals a pervasive trend of negative commentary towards the BLM movement on Hupu, which derives from China’s historical racial thinking and contemporary nationalist ideology. Hupu users’ expression of anti-Black sentiments reflects the nationalist underpinnings of China’s sports fandom and is dialectically connected to its “mainstream” geopolitical opinions. The research findings offer a fresh perspective on the perpetuation of Han chauvinism and racism within the Chinese-language social media sphere, shedding light on the intersections of sports culture, nationalism, and global sociopolitical movements.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speaker </strong></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><strong>Altman Yuzhu Peng</strong></strong> is an associate professor at the University of Warwick and received his PhD from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.
