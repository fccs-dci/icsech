I co-direct the Certificate in Political Economy, a program of the College of Liberal Arts. I am also a faculty affiliate of Global Studies and Asian Studies at Temple. I have served as a Global Order Visiting Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania's Perry World House. My research focuses on International and Comparative Political Economy of Development. I am completing my next book, under contract with Cambridge University Press, which investigates the mediating role of market governance in the relationship between global economic integration and development outcomes across industrial sectors in China, India, and Russia. Other ongoing projects examine Chinaâ€™s foreign economic engagement and its political impact on the developing world; and the political economy of identity in the global era.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
