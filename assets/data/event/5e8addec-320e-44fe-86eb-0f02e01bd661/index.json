Relatively little, however, has been conveyed regarding how China might view the U.S. today. In this talk, we bring together two eminent professors, Professor Jia Qingguo and Professor Wang Dong, from the School of International Studies, Peking University, to examine how policymakers, professionals, and average citizens in China might perceive the United States and what that might imply for the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. Dr. Thomas Fingar, Shorenstein APARC Fellow, will moderate the conversation.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
