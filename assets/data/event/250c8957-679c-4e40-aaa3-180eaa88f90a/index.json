The goal of the segregated education was to train Taiwanese boys and men to become government clerks and teachers, and girls and women to become “good wives, wise mothers” (<em>ryōsai kenbo</em>). This gendered education was part of <em>dōka</em>, the Japanese assimilation program, as it sought to make everyone in the empire “Japanese” as equals by teaching the Japanese language and imperial ethics with gendered roles. Constructed by engaging with the cult of domesticity in the West that envisioned the home as a private space for women and the workplace as a public space for men to build strong nation-states, “good wife, wise mother” emerged in Japan in the 1890s and was introduced to Taiwan in the same decade.</p>\n\n<p>Using periodicals and Japanese language textbooks, I examine the discourse and implementation of this ideal womanhood in Taiwan. This ideal of womanhood was crucial to the civilizing mission of the colonizers. Japanese colonial authority used gender to increase the supposed distance of civilizational levels between the colonizer and the colonized. By introducing gender into the discussion on <em>dōka</em> in Taiwan, I show that the promise of equality and inclusion from <em>dōka</em> became even less attainable and thus slowed assimilation to the supposedly superior Japanese civilization when colonial officials and educators characterized the colonized as feminine and depicted colonized women as the symbol of Taiwan’s “backwardness.”</p>\n\n<p>Gendered assimilation became almost attainable for the Taiwanese toward the end of World War II compared to the pre-war <em>dōka</em> efforts. Ethnic and class divisions were blurred during wartime mobilization as the colonial government expanded the responsibilities of schoolgirls and women, thus blurring the distinction between Taiwanese and Japanese. Wartime mobilization redefined gendered assimilation in colonial Taiwan, as it shifted the training and focus of “good wives, wise mothers”, from the individual households only, to the entire empire, which meant that schoolgirls were trained to become “good wives, wise mothers” of the empire.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speaker</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Fang Yu Hu</strong></strong>&nbsp;is Assistant Professor of History at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona where she teaches Chinese, Japanese, and world history classes.
