The US is seen as being relegated to the second position, with India following closely in third place. China's strategy to achieve superpower status includes increased focus on economic development and infrastructure expansion in the Indo-Pacific region to secure oil supplies. However, several key challenges stand in its way, including contentious issues with Taiwan, India, Japan, and South Korea. India's main concerns with China revolve around the dispute over the McMahon Line and the illegal occupation of Aksai-Chin since the 1950s, which sparked the Sino-Indian war in 1962. Recent reports of China constructing a railway line along the Aksai-Chin Road have significant implications for India's security at the northern borders. The talk discusses the implications of the construction in detail, and also looks at the options India has to ramp up its security and safeguard its own interests. These include strengthening infrastructure along its northern borders, particularly in Ladakh, diversifying transportation routes to Ladakh, enhancing airfield capabilities in the northern plains, and strengthening diplomatic ties with regional powers such as South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Australia.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
