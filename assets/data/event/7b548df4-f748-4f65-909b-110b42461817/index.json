China has notably evolved its approach to big data governance, punctuated by the launch of its Big Data Strategy in 2015 and the establishment of the State Data Bureau in 2023. Despite these developments, there is limited scholarly understanding of the rationales behind these changes and their potential ramifications. This study scrutinizes the evolving policy focus and governance structure in China’s big data landscape based on a comprehensive review of official documents. Additionally, the research delves into the potential challenges within the current governance architecture, particularly in terms of bureaucratic politics, including both formal structures and individual resistance. Our preliminary findings provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamism in China's big data governance strategy and offer insights into potential obstacles and challenges confronting future policy implementation and public administration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dr. Xiang Gao is a professor in the School of Public Affairs at Zhejiang University.
