He is best remembered for his translations of Chinese philosophical texts from Chinese into German. His version of the&nbsp;<i>Yijing&nbsp;</i>(I Ging, 1924) has been translated into many other languages including English, and so became widely influential.<br />\n<br />\n-&nbsp; In his version of the Confucian Analects /&nbsp;<i>Lunyu</i>&nbsp;(1910), he originally produced it in two translated versions — a \"literal version\" and a \"modern version\".&nbsp; Most subsequent editions eliminated the \"modern version\". Why? He also at least in one place translated the term&nbsp;<i>li</i>&nbsp;禮 as \"Religion\". Why?<br />\n- Wilhelm's version of the&nbsp;<i>Daodejing</i>&nbsp;renders the terms<i>&nbsp;wu</i>&nbsp;無 and&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;有 as&nbsp;<i>Nichtsein</i>&nbsp;(Non-being) and&nbsp;<i>Sein</i>&nbsp;(Being). How should we consider this rendering today in the light of sinological interpretations of these terms within this context?<br />\n- Why is Wilhelm's version of the&nbsp;<i>Zhuangzi</i>&nbsp;missing the last seven chapters?<br />\n- Wilhelm's rendering of&nbsp;<i>shengren</i>&nbsp;聖人in the Yijing was regularly&nbsp;<i>Die Heilige</i>&nbsp;(the saints), yet in Carl Bayne's English rendering of Wilhelm's work, he always rendered the term as \"sage\". Why is this an important misrepresentation of Wilhelm's presentation of that difficult classical text?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
