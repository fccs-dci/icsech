Certainly, when studying the long tradition of Iran and China, we can perceive that the Silk Road was not only linking cities like Xi’an and Isfahan for trade but also facilitated, the exchange of ideas, sciences, education, and intellectual exchanges. One of the most important aspects of Iran and China relations in ancient times is religion. Persian religions including Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism were spread to China by the Iranian elites who have also played an important role in non-Iranian religions in this regard. The relationship between China and Iran has intertwined in history as well as the old and new Silk Road projects and BRI. Indeed, cultural contacts and mutual influence via the Silk Road have been robust throughout the centuries. This lecture proposes a new understanding of the old relationship between the two nations in the present cultural and political climate.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
