Using examples drawn from the history of Chinese traumatology during the 7th to 18th centuries, Dr. Wu will discuss the place of the physical and material body in Chinese medical thought and show how awareness of body structure was in fact intertwined with understandings of function.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
