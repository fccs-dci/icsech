CAI will serve as an important tool to open Chinese markets for EU companies. Despite the talk of a &#039;geopolitical&#039; EU and a common transatlantic front against assertive China, the deal has once again shown that what matters most to its member states is economics &amp; some EU countries project it as a sign of their strategic autonomy from the US.<br />\nWith prospects of liberal investment opportunities in a lucrative Chinese market, the &#039;decoupling&#039; from China narrative will become weaker in Europe. Despite labeling China as a &#039;systemic rival&#039; and &#039;economic competitor&#039;, Brussels does not want to be on the wrong side of a rising power. The CAI deal rather shows that it is ready to take advantage of emerging geopolitical dynamics in the Indo-Pacific.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
