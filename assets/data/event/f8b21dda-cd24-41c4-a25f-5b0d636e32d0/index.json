In this lecture, Professor Chan will present cautionary remarks and illustrative examples suggesting that the determination of a country’s influence abroad is far more challenging than the familiar claims we often encounter in the news media and even some scholarly publications. Concerns for making valid inference are no less apposite or compelling for studying China’s international influence as for that of other countries. The analytical issues he raises in this lecture are thus generic and not peculiar to the study of China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
