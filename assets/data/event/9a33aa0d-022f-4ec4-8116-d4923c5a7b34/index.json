Challenging understandings of empire that focus on bilateral relations between metropole and colonial periphery, the book uncovers a half century of dynamic relations between Japan, Taiwan, China, and Western regional powers. Japanese officials in Taiwan did not simply take orders from Tokyo; rather, they often pursued their own expansionist ambitions in South China and Southeast Asia. When outright conquest was not possible, they promoted alternative strategies, including naturalizing resident Chinese as overseas Taiwanese subjects, extending colonial police networks, and deploying tens of thousands of Taiwanese to war. Drawing on multilingual archives in six countries,&nbsp;<em>Imperial Gateway</em>&nbsp;shows how Japanese officials and Taiwanese subjects transformed Taiwan into a regional gateway for expansion in an ever-shifting international order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This event will be available in-person in HUB 332 and online.</strong>&nbsp;To join us, please visit our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/481354844297\">Eventbrite page to register</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seiji Shirane</strong>&nbsp;is an Assistant Professor of Japanese History at The City College of New York (CUNY), where his teaching and research interests include Japan’s empire, Taiwan, and Sino-Japanese relations.
