This has not precluded China’s more recent initiatives in creating new international institutions headquartered in China like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). While the PRC’s actions within global governance structures have been increasingly used to assert its strategic interests, the creation of international structures headquartered in China provides it with a “safety net” to pursue its core multilateral objectives in the Eurasian region. How will these two dimensions influence China’s navigation of an increasingly fractured multilateral global governance system?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
