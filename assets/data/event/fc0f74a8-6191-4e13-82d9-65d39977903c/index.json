This election offers a potentially historic four-way race between the two party&nbsp;heavyweights, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Kuomintang (KMT), joined by the relatively new&nbsp;Taiwan People's Party (TPP) and an independent candidate. As tensions are running high between Taipei and Beijing as well as Beijing and Washington, the implications of this election can reverberate across the Taiwan Strait and Pacific. What are the stakes of the 2024 elections, and what are the potential consequences for Taiwan's domestic and foreign policies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The 2024 elections follow the hit Taiwanese Netflix show, Wave Makers, earlier this year. Wave Makers portrays a fictional presidential election in Taiwan, offering audiences a glimpse into not just electoral politics but also hot button issues of environmentalism, social justice, and gender equality. After allegations of sexual crimes emerged&nbsp;that mirrored the fictional events in Wave Makers, the show was credited with sparking Taiwan's MeToo movement. How does Wave Makers affect Taiwanese society's relationship with elections? What are the broader implications of popular media portrayals of Taiwanese politics?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This event is free and open to the public and&nbsp;will be streamed via our Facebook page and&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/live/kbJ_HSZ9TBo?si%3DNuvoAx8CVIQGjhzO&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698345219185000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XJUEVIMiWwyj0270_K_0z\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/kbJ_HSZ9TBo?si=NuvoAx8CVIQGjhzO\" id=\"m_-4550726289338390887OWAf99e8576-ae7e-40be-bc02-4f10e81a70d8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fb.me/e/2HvX7jPZR&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698345219185000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0sqUshk9RQ2n_M5AYWyrq0\" href=\"https://fb.me/e/2HvX7jPZR\" id=\"m_-4550726289338390887OWA79e2677e-9642-9c12-a3f2-8c7ee79bb4f7\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to register via Facebook.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
