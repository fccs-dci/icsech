China is the world&#039;s largest investor in coal, but also renewable and nuclear energy. Peaking emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 will require resolving these and many other contradictions. Lauri Myllyvirta will present his latest analysis and research from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
