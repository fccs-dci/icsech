How will China use its new position to change the world? How does the country’s rise change its self-perception? Manjari Chatterjee Miller will discuss how China’s elites actively reframe the country’s image based on her book &#039;Why Nations Rise: Narratives and the Path to Great Power&#039; (Oxford University Press 2021). Lina Benabdallah’s presentation probes the type of power mechanisms that build, diffuse, and project China’s power in Africa. It draws on her book &#039;Shaping the future of power.
