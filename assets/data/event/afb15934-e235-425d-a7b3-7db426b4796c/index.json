Lin and Wang&#039;s empirical analysis found that 78 percent of China financed and completed projects in soft and hard infrastructures have addressed Africaâ€˜s bottlenecks, thereby creating public assets, which could generate income and jobs. These public assets could also provide a cushion during times of financial crisis. On Wednesday, October 20, join Yan Wang, Senior Academic Researcher at the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, for a discussion on China and Africa&#039;s investment history and how they can rethink their development cooperation post-pandemic. This webinar is part of the Fall 2021 Global China Research Colloquium.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
