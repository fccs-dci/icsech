Authoritarian regimes increasingly use overseas propaganda and information campaigns to legitimize their model of governance, increase their political influence, reshape global narratives, and at times undermine democratic systems. Such information campaigns have the potential not just to affect great power competition but also to influence domestic political attitudes in target countries. In particular, we identify two different messaging strategies – <i>Autocratic Advantage</i>, which emphasizes the performance and procedural benefits of authoritarian governance, versus <i>Democratic Disarray</i>, which highlights the performance and procedural shortcomings of democratic governance – and compare their persuasiveness across four issue areas commonly discussed in authoritarian overseas propaganda. </span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Audrye Wong</span></span></b><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"> is an assistant professor of political science and international relations at the University of Southern California.
