This talk argues that, in the context of technological transition—here, from an agricultural to an industrial economy—a legal system that facilitates the re-assignment of property rights, making certain rights less secure, plays an important and under-theorized role in promoting economic growth. Specifically, the ability to re-assign land rights from lower-value to higher-value users is crucial. The legal system not only facilitates re-assignment but also manages conflict over insecure property rights. The legal system itself plays an important role in generating regime support and containing the conflict generated by state actions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
