Next, it analyses the style, manner and effectiveness of Australian Prime Ministers and other key foreign-policy makers in making Australian policy on China. Next, it charts how Australian policy on China has changed over different political periods. It also highlights Australian policy to China as a global case study for other countries who are closely examining and learning lessons from how one Asia-Pacific middle-power has dealt with the Chinese colossus.</span></span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
