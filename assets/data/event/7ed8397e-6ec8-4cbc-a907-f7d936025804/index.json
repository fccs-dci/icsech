Following that small gathering, the USHCA representatives then joined close to 200 guests from around the U.S. to attend an exclusive dinner at which President Xi delivered a significant speech in which he shared China's openness to cooperation and posed a crucial question: \"Are we partners or are we adversaries?\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Biden-Xi meeting and the special reception and dinner on that day have led to many recent positive developments in US-China relations. In this webinar, Susan Thornton, USHCA Vice-Chair, and one of the leading American experts on China, will lead a discussion about the 2024 prospects for U.S.-China ties based on their take-aways from the San Francisco meetings and their other interactions with U.S. and Chinese counterparts.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
