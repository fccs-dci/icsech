The region is also an important component of the BRI New Eurasian Land Bridge, providing alternative access to Western Europe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is shaking up China’s plans and prospects in this part of Eurasia. With the closing of borders between Russia and the EU, China’s long-term interests are arguably at risk. The war is also resulting in geopolitical shifts and hardening divisions between the West on the one hand, and China and Russia on the other. This panel discusses China’s response to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the impact that today’s dramatic developments will have on China’s presence in Eastern Europe and its BRI plans.</p>\n\n<p>This event is sponsored by the <a href=\"https://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu/\">Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies</a> and the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.</p>"}}},"context":{}}
