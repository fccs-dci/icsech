Every year lots of great books about China get published, books that deserve to be widely read and discussed. Book reviews are helpful, but take months or even years to come out. To make it easier for China scholars to discuss with each other some of the recent English-language books they are reading, the University of Washington China Studies Program has started a virtual China Studies Book Club. We think it will be fun to have conversations about books we find exciting, provocative, or moving and invite China scholars elsewhere to join us.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
