Assistant Professor Ke Li of John Jay College of the City University of New York will discuss her book <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=32710\">Marriage Unbound: State Law, Power, and Inequality in Contemporary China</a>. Drawing on years of ethnographic and archival research, paired with unprecedented access to the grassroots court system, this book closely examines Chinese womenâ€™s struggles with divorce litigation. In this way, Professor Li elevates otherwise unheard voices and unpacks the complex interplay of law and politics in an authoritarian state.</p>\n\n<p><em>About the Speaker</em></p>\n\n<p>Ke LI is an assistant professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
