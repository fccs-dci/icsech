On the one hand, the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have tested human survival and exacerbated pre-existing conflicts and crises. On the other, technological advancements, with artificial intelligence at the forefront, have presented new ways of working and living. Waves of social change have swept through societies, leaving imprints on individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Yet social change is nothing new but has affected people in different ways throughout history. How have these societal changes created, engaged and influenced the experiences of individuals in Chinese societies and communities across the globe? From past to present, how have individuals negotiated social, political, economic and/or cultural changes?</p>\n\n<p>This interdisciplinary conference will bring scholars from various fields together to explore how Chinese individuals have navigated social change.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
