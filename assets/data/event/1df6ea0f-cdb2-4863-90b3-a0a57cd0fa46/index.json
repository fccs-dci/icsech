When she decided to enroll in a local cooking school–held in an unheated classroom with nary a measuring cup in sight–she jumped into the ring herself.</p>\n<p>Progressing from cooking student to noodle-stall and dumpling-house apprentice to intern at a chic Shanghai restaurant, she finds poor young men and women streaming in from the provinces in search of a “rice bowl” (living wage); a burgeoning urban middle class hungry for luxury after decades of turmoil and privation; and the mentors who take her in hand in the kitchen and beyond.</p>\n<p>Together they present an unforgettable slice of contemporary China in the full swing of social and economic transformation.”</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
