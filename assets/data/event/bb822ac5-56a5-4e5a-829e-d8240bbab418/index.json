While dam-building &amp; water diversion threatens regional stability, there is no sign of an effective bilateral or multilateral water management accord in the Brahmaputra basin. Countries sharing a river need to resolve the issues through effective hydro-diplomacy but the bilateral tensions that spur the dam-building race make the river a victim, with devastating consequences for the fragile ecology and the people of the region.</p>\n<p>Countries in the Brahmaputra basin share the same water resources and ecological corridors, and any disaster that strikes upon a country will have a trans-border impact. Can addressing water-security challenges create an alternative pathway for pooling resources, building political will, preventing conflicts, and promoting transboundary cooperation between India and China?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
