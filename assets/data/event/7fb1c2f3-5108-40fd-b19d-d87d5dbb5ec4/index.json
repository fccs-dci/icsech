This process of national identification has roots in cultural ideology as shaped by changing Nationalist policy and practice to the present. 1990 is also a crucial juncture for viewing a transition from a sinocentric politicizing regime to a Taiwanizing one. My analysis of the school in time and practice, both in the context of education as curriculum and social organization, establishes in my opinion a different critical perspective on contemporary Taiwan. At the same time, it serves as a new paradigm for critical ethnography in cultural studies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Allen Chun</strong>&nbsp;is Research Fellow Emeritus in the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.
