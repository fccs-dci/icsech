What is the relationship between courage and virtues such as integrity, loyalty, resilience, and self-sacrifice in the definition of a hero? To what extent can heroism coexist with fear, pain, and shame? What role do education and role models play in a hero's journey to becoming a hero? What is the ethical significance of heroism? Does the standard of heroism differ by gender? Lastly, how can understanding different cultures help us answer the above questions?<br />\n<br />\n- Language: Putonghua<br />\n- Venue: SWT 702, Level 7, Shaw Tower, Hong Kong Baptist University<br />\n- Online: ZOOM&nbsp;<br />\nLink:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/96903819508?pwd=bFhSTGF0alM0Z0U0YjRTaHYrYnlDZz09\" target=\"_blank\">https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/96903819508?pwd=bFhSTGF0alM0Z0U0YjRTaHYrYnlDZz09</a><br />\nMeeting ID: 969 0381 9508<br />\nPassword: 973008<br />\n<br />\nThis lecture series is sponsored by Eurasia Foundation (from Asia).
