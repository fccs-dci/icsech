For decades, especially since 1979, US policy was &quot;engagement&quot; with China in the belief that this would lead to political and economic liberalization. The Deng-articulated policy of &quot;hide and bide&quot; did not challenge this assumption directly. The Obama-Biden administration, from 2009- 2016, struggled to find the right approach, moving from &quot;strategic reassurance&quot; to &quot;pivot&quot; &amp; then &quot;rebalance&quot;. The Trump Administration initially vacillated, but later defined China as a rival, and ratcheted up tariff, technology denial, and other restrictions.</p>\n<p>Would a Biden Administration build further on the Trump-era characterization of China as rival, predator, authoritarian; or would it be conditioned more by the search for common ground? This Webinar tries to answer several such questions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
