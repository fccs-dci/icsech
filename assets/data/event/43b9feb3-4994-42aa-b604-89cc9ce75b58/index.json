More specifically, it will argue that there was a group of people Dr. Kim calls &quot;inner Kirghiz&quot; who were firmly incorporated into Qing Xinjiang, thereby bridging the Qing world and the Central Asian world. The case of the inner Kirghiz highlights the blurred boundary between Qing and &quot;foreign&quot; as well as the plurality of Qing Xinjiang society.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
