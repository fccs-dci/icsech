This book talk for<em>&nbsp;The Emergence of Global Maoism: China’s Red Evangelism and the Cambodian Communist Movement, 1949-1979</em>&nbsp;(Cornell University Press, 2022) explores the link between the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to globalize Maoism and the dialectical engagement of exported Maoism by intellectuals who became Maoists in Cambodia. It expands upon Edward Said’s concept of “Traveling Theory,” which identifies conditions of production, transmission, and reception, to explain how Maoism emerged in Cambodian intellectual circles. The book talk examines the intellectual journey of one of its Maoist intellectuals under analysis, Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) Minister of Information Hu Nim (aka.&nbsp;<em>Comrade Phoas</em>). During his studies in Paris in the 1950s and after trips to China in the 1960s, Hu founded the Khmer-Chinese Friendship Association (<em>Samāgam Mittphāp Khmer-Chin</em>) and served the Maoist CPK until his execution at&nbsp;<em>Tuol Sleng</em>&nbsp;(S-21). The book talk emphasizes Hu’s story as one of&nbsp;<em>becoming&nbsp;</em>in which the central roles of&nbsp;<em>community&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>network&nbsp;</em>pushed him towards radicalization. It also charts the course of Maoisms, global and local, by making broader sense of Hu Nim’s life and by referring to organizations in which he participated actively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Matthew Galway</strong>&nbsp;is a Lecturer of Chinese History at the Australian National University.
