It describes how the book uses archival research and recently released oral history accounts from the 1980s and 1990s to restore the voices of the Unofficials (the Unofficial Members of Exco and Legco), and thus revisits the 1982-1984 negotiation of the Joint Declaration from a Hong Kong perspective. The talk also explores the media creation of the King of Kowloon as an icon symbolising Hong Kong identity. It will introduce research investigating the mechanics of icon creation by showing how both Anglophone and Sinophone Hong Kong newspapers represented the King of Kowloon across three separate decades. It will also investigate the differing depictions in Anglophone and Sinophone public spheres, as well as using autoethnographic self-reflective practice to interrogate the narrator’s roles as a Hong Kong author, researcher and journalist.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Louisa Lim </span></b><span style=\"color:black\">is the author of <i>Indelible City; Dispossession and Defiance in Hong Kong</i>, published by Riverhead books.
