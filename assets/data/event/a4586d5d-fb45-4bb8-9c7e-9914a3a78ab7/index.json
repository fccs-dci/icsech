While the rise of regional trade agreements is partly a response to desire for a more stable business environment, it also risks creating an unwieldy set of international trade rules that undercut rather than facilitate the ease of doing business transnationally. In this context of uncertainties generated by recent developments, what has been China's response as a major trading power?
