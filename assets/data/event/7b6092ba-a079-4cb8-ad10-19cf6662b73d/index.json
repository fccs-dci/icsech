Yet China, the world&#039;s largest and most powerful authoritarian state, has expanded its social health insurance system at an unprecedented rate, increasing enrollment from 20 percent of its population in 2000 to 95 percent in 2012. </p>\n<p>In this book talk, Xian Huang (bio) analyzes the transformation of China&#039;s social health insurance in the first decade of the 2000s, addressing its expansion and how it is distributed. Drawing from government documents, filed interviews, survey data, and government statistics, she reveals that Chinese leaders have a strategy of &quot;stratified expansion,&quot; perpetuating a particularly privileged program for the elites while developing an essentially modest health provision for the masses. She contends that this strategy effectively balances between elites and masses to maximize the regime&#039;s prospects of stability.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
