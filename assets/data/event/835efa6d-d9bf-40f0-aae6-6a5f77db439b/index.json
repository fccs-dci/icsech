But the main contest concerns the strategic waters associated with those islands. To consolidate control over this vital maritime space, China's leaders&nbsp;have begun to enforce \"China's Law of the Sea\" by building domestic legal institutions, bureaucratic organizations, and a naval and maritime law enforcement apparatus that overmatches regional&nbsp;challengers and imposes costs on naval&nbsp;powers around the globe. Dr. Kardon and Dr. Dutton will explore questions such as, will states choose to acquiesce to China's preferences? Will there be conflict? Or will states find peaceful ways to overcome China's challenge to the international maritime order?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
