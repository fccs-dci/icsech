These problems include: abuse of workers at factories under contract to multinationals; pollution and destruction of habitats by the factories, supporting infrastructure, and raw materials extraction; and in Xinjiang, forcing ethnic minorities to work in farms and factories that export their products. Since the global supply chain model emerged in the 1990s, responses have included self-regulation by factories and their multinational clients, sometimes in response to consumer boycotts in rich countries; attempted intervention using local law or laws of the investor or buyer country; “naming and shaming” by NGOs; and foreign government sanctions. Speakers will assess why these approaches have often failed, identify successes, and offer their own prescriptions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
