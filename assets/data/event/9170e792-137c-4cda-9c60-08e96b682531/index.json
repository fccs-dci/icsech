Both were American-returned students who embraced the ideas of Frederick Winslow Taylor as potential solutions to China’s ills. Like many Republican elites, they subscribed to dismissal assessments of their fellow countrymen and worked to integrate Taylorism across Chinese society as a technocratic tool to control and reform the unwashed masses. From the textile industry and cotton agriculture to vocational education and personal behavior, they worked with networks of fellow reformers and American-returned students to transform the Chinese people into more efficient and thereby more productive and valuable citizens in their eyes.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
