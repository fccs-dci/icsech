This international order is facing severe challenges due to the rise of new powers, breakdown of old economic arrangements, and a redistribution of technological and infrastructural activity. This academic year, we are planning a series of panels that seek to examine emerging political, technological, and economic arrangements that are replacing an older international order.</p>\n\n<p>The November 2nd panel there will be a panel that discusses how global governance institutions reflect changing geopolitics and international political economy. We hope to deliberate on the impact of new powers like China, India, and other countries in the global South, and how they are leading to new distributions of power, norms, and expertise.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
