Having secured a third term as Party General Secretary and installed loyalists in key positions, Xi is well-positioned to advance both his domestic and foreign policy agendas. As Xi noted in his political report to the Party Congress, China is \"actively involved in setting global security rules\" and \"in the reform and development of the global governance system.\" What is Xi's vision for the international order? Will there be adjustments in Chinese foreign policy to address the decline in China's global image and deterioration of its relations with numerous countries in recent years, including Australia? What will be his approach to the United States? Is reunification with Taiwan a top priority?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonnie S.
