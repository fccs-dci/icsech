Each month we’ll be heading live to a different part of China to bring our favorite experiences to you, wherever in the world you may be.</p>\n<p>At WildChina, we believe in showing the real China, so in this episode we’ll be heading to one of China’s most famous tourism destinations, Yangshuo, where we’ll be diving beneath the well-groomed tourist facade and chatting with the locals who make their livelihood in this beautiful place. We’ll be following WildChina guide, Michael Zhao, as he chats with a bamboo raft skipper, cycles through the farms of the countryside, and ends at a beautiful boutique hotel with a charming backstory.</p>\n<p>We hope this live hour will give you a peek in to the real Yangshuo, the one the locals live in.
