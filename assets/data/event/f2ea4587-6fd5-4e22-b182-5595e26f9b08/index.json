In the Xi Jinping era, it has been selectively incorporated into the CCP’s political ideology as never before, and cultural nationalists include not only scholars but also Party-state leaders. The game changer in this historic development is the Chinese Dream, which centres on, among other things, ‘the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’, including a cultural renaissance. The latter does not simply mean the promotion of traditional beliefs, ideas, values and practices; it has also entailed broader Sinicisation of Marxism and deeper nationalisation of the Party and the state. As the CCP transforms itself from a class organisation to a national party and the PRC from a class-state to a nation-state, it is logical to make the nation instead of ‘the people’ (including four classes) the ‘masters of the country’ and to reconcile Marxism with cultural traditions. However, core Marxist doctrines are irreconcilable with ‘Chinese orientations’. What is presented as the Sinicisation of Marxism in the PRC is actually the hollowing out of Marxism. Instead of continuing to march forward towards communism, the CCP is going back to the past and reviving selected elements of China’s traditional value system, which it rejected between 1921 and the late 1980s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yingjie Guo</strong>&nbsp;is Professor in Chinese Studies.
