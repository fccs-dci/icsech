While numerous texts demonstrate the elderly adults’ complaints about their physical decline, psychological uneasiness, and mental discomfort, positive writings that reflect the authors’ pleasure in and gratitude for getting old are also available in large quantity. Over three hundred keywords representing happy, sad, or the mixed feelings and complicated moods of the Qing elderly are highlighted in the exhibition.Besides, pictures visualizing old age and featuring past techniques to reassured aged persons are also displayed. The on-site book exhibition invites viewers to brainstorm situating the elderly in history and the significance of “age” as a category of historical analysis. </p>"}}},"context":{}}
