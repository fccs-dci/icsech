This presentation by Dr. William Fischer (Senior Lecturer of Operations Management, MIT Sloan School of Management) offers a profile of one of China&#039;s most ambitious competitors-the world&#039;s largest manufacturer of home appliances.</p>\n<p>Dr. Fischer will share his insights about how the Haier organization has repeatedly reinvented its business model and corporate culture in an effort to achieve and sustain its success. His presentation also will include an examination of Haier&#039;s transformation, highlighting how these lessons can be applied to other business organizations, especially regarding the harnessing and utilization of talent.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
