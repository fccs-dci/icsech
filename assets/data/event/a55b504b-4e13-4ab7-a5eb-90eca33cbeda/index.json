Dr. Lance Gore in his paper, “Socialism without Social Development in China: The Consequences at Home and Abroad” argues omnipresence of the state with a paranoia of losing control has resulted in the shutting down of social space in some areas and its shrinkage in others. In their paper “Current CPC Regime’s Extreme Censorship Control Using Technology”, Arun Teja Polcumpally and Vatsala Mishra argue that the Chinese people accept censorship both due to threat by the regime as well as getting oppressed is ingrained in their psyche and the same is substantiated from the historical trace of censorship which has been normalized in Chinese society.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
