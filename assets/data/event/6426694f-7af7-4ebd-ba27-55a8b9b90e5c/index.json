No single reason – such as regime type, surveillance technology, or experience with past epidemics - seems to explain these countries’ comparative achievements. This panel will bring together experts from different states including Japan, Vietnam, China, and South Korea. The juxtaposition of these national experiences will aim to illuminate the constellation of historical, political, infrastructural and other factors that undergird competent public health responses.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
