In real life, the “meal” that is being prepared is a detailed evidence dossier that is assembled by police and passed on to the prosecutors and court; it becomes the basis for the court’s decision of guilt or innocence. Dr. Grace (Yu) Mou, who observed the preparation of the “meal” or case dossier while embedded inside a local prosecutors’ office in China, will explain how the process works, and why it makes prevention of wrongful convictions very difficult.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
