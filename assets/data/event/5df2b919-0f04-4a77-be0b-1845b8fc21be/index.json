Bays (1942-2019) passed away. The fields of modern Chinese history, Christianity in China, and the history of U.S.-China relations lost a wonderful thinker, leader, and helper. As U.S.-China relations are at their lowest point in the four decades since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979, it is of particular importance to reflect on the deep roots and human dimensions of those relations so eminently represented in the study of Christianity in China which Dr. Daniel H. Bays pioneered. The remembrance of Dr. Bays at this memorial roundtable aims to give human substance, perspective, and hope to future academic scholarship on China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
