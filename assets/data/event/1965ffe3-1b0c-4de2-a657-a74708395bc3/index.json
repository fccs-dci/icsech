The phenomenon is widespread and increasing, and is a typical product of commercialization of healthcare since implementation of Economic Reforms in 1979-80. CCTV reported that in 2010 alone there were 17,243 medical disputes, an increase of almost 7000 cases from 2005, while major disturbances involving physical aggression doubled from 9831 in 2006 to 17,243 in 2010. Since 2012, on an average, over 12,000 health professionals have been attacked every year, and over 25% of China&#039;s nursing staff have reported having experienced Yinao. Politically speaking, widespread resentment on social media and high rate of public approval of Yinao phenomenon speaks volumes about poor governance and anti-people nature of the regime. No wonder, Yinao phenomenon has been described by Chinese scholars as the &quot;weapon of the weak.&quot;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
