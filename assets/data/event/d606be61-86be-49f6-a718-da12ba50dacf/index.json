Or a newer and bigger one? Questions like these have been bubbling up ever since Hainan Province, China’s only tropical island, became China’s largest Free Trade Zone. Often referred to as the “Hawaii of the Orient”, Hainan is not only the world’s most dynamic tourism destination with a projected 80 million Chinese domestic visitors alone in 2021 but also the largest “lab” of the latest sustainable development experiment of the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>Thanks to close collaborations with our friends at Arizona State University, USHCA is bringing a diverse set of experts to provide an introductory overview of Hainan province, its vision for a green and sustainable future, and business opportunities related to Free Trade Port and Free Trade Zone promotional incentives.</p>\n<p>This event is part of USHCA’s ongoing series, The Way Forward, where we discuss different ideas and initiatives used by the US and China and how they can be applied to the Heartland region.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
