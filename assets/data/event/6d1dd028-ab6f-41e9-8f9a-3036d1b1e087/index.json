Now that China has applied to join the CPTPP, economic interests and leverage to reform China provide reasons to engage in accession talks with Beijing. But there is a risk that the CPTPP will be held hostage to ongoing geopolitical tensions. The case presents a challenge for Japan in its new leadership role as flag bearer for free trade. Harvard Professor Christina Davis, author of the book chapter Japan: Interest Group Politics, Foreign Policy Linkages, and TPP (from the book Megaregulation Contested: Global Economic Ordering After TPP), will discuss how Japan and the US view China’s application, drawing on her extensive research on Japan’s foreign policy interests and domestic political processes. Dr. David Malone, UN under-secretary-general, will be guest moderator.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
