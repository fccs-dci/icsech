This Student Event will center around themes such as belonging, identity, and cross-cultural understanding. Now that we are living in a “post-pandemic” world, this Story Circle will encourage students in our community to assess what has changed for them in the past few years and challenge them to consider how international events like a global pandemic can bring us closer together. The event is open to English and Chinese speaking students from all corners of the globe! Forward to your local university or register below!</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
