Despite their offense being biological and involuntary, women faced the inescapable punishment of drinking from a pool of their own bloody discharge for all eternity. While the sources portray women&#039;s consignment to Blood Lake Hell as an inescapable fate, they also offer a wide range of rituals that promised escape. The lecture examines a particular group of Daoist rituals relate to the legends of virgin mothers and their sons. Highlighting the virgin birth and the mother-son bond, this soteriology removed the father from the picture, undermining the patrilineal principle that was the linchpin of the &quot;Confucian&quot; order and allowing women to claim an inalienable right to their children and carve out a space of their own where they were the sole objects of devotion.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
