The missionaries’ activities in various domains, i.e. religious, scientific, philosophic, among others, lent themselves to different appreciations of their presence in late Ming China. In turn, this presentation examines how the status of ‘foreigners’ in diverse seventeenth-century Chinese sources could lead to inclusive perspectives of the Jesuits and their contributions on local soil or, on the contrary, to exclusive views of the Europeans in China, within contexts of disagreement and/or hostility.</p>\n\n<p>Ana Carolina Hosne&nbsp;is Assistant Researcher at the National Council for Scientific Research (CONICET), Argentina.&nbsp;She specialises in early modern mission history and cultural exchanges between China, Europe and colonial Latin America in the early modern period, with special focus on Jesuit missions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
