Advocates of hard countermeasures toward China say previous US administrations’ failure to counter Chinese challenges resulted in China now posing an enormous danger to American interests. Critics play down past failures and dangers posed by China, condemn excesses in the recent US hard-line, and favor a more moderate and nuanced approach. Robert Sutter’s fifth edition overhauls previous editions to offer a comprehensive evidence-based assessment of Chinese foreign behavior to conclude that the United States, its allies and partners are fundamentally challenged by wide-ranging and intensifying Chinese efforts to weaken America in headlong pursuit of ever expanding Chinese ambitions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
