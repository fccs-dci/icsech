Even countries that had been categorised as having ‘better performing’ health service systems, faced challenges in managing the pandemic. This talk would take the Chinese health system as a case in point to demonstrate the evolution of a complex health system and fault lines that exist and have been accentuated especially in the Covid context. China’s health reforms have witnessed significant shifts especially since the SARS epidemic of 2002. The reforms have been consistently striving for universal access and equitable health systems and yet have fallen short of delivering during COVID years. This talk attempts to unravel the past and the present reforms in China and what it means for the future of health systems in China and lessons that can be drawn for other health systems.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
