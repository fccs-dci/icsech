How can we make the “obscure” (to non-specialists) discoverable? What are the expected and unexpected results of making an audiovisual archive public, as measured by views, comments, likes, or Google Analytics data? And what happens when your book project morphs into a multi-platform digital extravaganza?</p>\n\n<p>This presentation will share discoveries from the first few years of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinesefilmclassics.org/\">Chinese Film Classics Project</a>&nbsp;(chinesefilmclassics.org), an ongoing international effort to make early Chinese cinema history more accessible to the English-speaking world.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asia.ubc.ca/profile/christopher-rea/\">Christopher&nbsp;Rea</a>&nbsp;will speak about his experiences building an online course while writing his book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chinese-film-classics-19221949/9780231188135\"><em>Chinese Film Classics, 1922-1949</em></a>&nbsp;(Columbia UP, 2021), and how he worked with collaborators to create the world’s largest free digital archive of early Chinese films with English translations. He will illustrate the talk with examples of “playlist pedagogy,” including curatorial techniques that highlight significant features of Chinese films, from songs to special effects.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>About the Speaker:&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.ubc.ca/profile/christopher-rea/\" title=\"https://asia.ubc.ca/profile/christopher-rea/\">Christopher&nbsp;Rea</a>&nbsp;is Professor of Chinese and former Director of the Center for Chinese Research at the University of British Columbia.
