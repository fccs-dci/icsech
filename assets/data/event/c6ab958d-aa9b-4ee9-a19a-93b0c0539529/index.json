Gelatt Dialogue on the Rule of Law in East Asia: Climate Change in Asia-Pacific</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1647282519895_280\">Panel 4: Corporate Governance and Climate Change in Asia-Pacific</h2>\n\n<p>States take the center stage at global climate negotiations, but corporations sit squarely in the crosshairs as contributors to climate change, casualties of the fallout, and indispensable participants in any response. Governments, investors, and publics across Asia-Pacific are increasingly demanding that corporations do more to address the climate crisis. Jennifer G. Hill at Monash University School of Law, Yumiko Miwa at Meiji University School of Commerce, and Umakanth Varottil at National University of Singapore School of Law will discuss changing views on the social role of corporations and corporate governance in Australia, India, and Japan from a comparative perspective.&nbsp;Bruce Aronson will moderate the discussion.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
