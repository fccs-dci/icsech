Many commentators have expressed concern that the country is defying the Western path of sustainable development guided by the rule of law and good governance standards. Adopting the frame of &#039;adaptive governance,&#039; the presentation looks at the attitude of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) toward corporate social responsibility (CRS) in Chinese-Financed BRI Railroad Megaprojects in East Africa. Through a comparative case study of Chinese loans for infrastructure in East Africa (the Standard Gauge Railroad in Kenya and the Ethiopia-Djibouti railroad), the presentation offers a more systematic assessment of what kind of governance China is in fact practicing through the BRI and what are the reasons behind its ‘adaptive governance’ approach.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
