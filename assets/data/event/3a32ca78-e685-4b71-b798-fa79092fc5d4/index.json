But beyond their personal connections to Xi, what do we know about the six men joining him on the PSC? On paper, their credentials may look typical: two sitting PSC members, the party secretaries of Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangdong, and Xi's de facto chief of staff. But several of the new members- most notably, Li Qiang, the presumed next premier, and Cai Qi-skipped steps in the typical career trajectory. The new emphasis on loyalty over experience sets the tone for Xi's \"New Era': Xi wants men who will enforce his decision, not technocrats to make policy decisions of their own. The case of Li Qiang's handling of shanghai's COVID-19 outbreak is an instructive example of what we can expect from the new PSC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>David Zweig</strong>, Professor Emeritus, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Distinguished Visiting Professor of Taipei School of Economics and Political Science, National Tsinghua University, Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p><em>&nbsp; \"The Path Not Taken\"</em></p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;talk will focus on the direction China has taken since Xi Jinping and the leadership decided to turn away from the 60-point market reform package of 2013, and instead, adopted the \"Made in China 2025\" development strategy. The result has been a much more statist domestic economic agenda and a much more mercantilist foreign policy agenda. The 20th Party Congress, with its rejection of any reformist wing, is doubling down on nationalism, Marxism-Leninism, and the Xi thought, and the consolidation of central power simply reinforces trends begun almost a decade before.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Manoranjan Mohanty</strong>, Emeritus Fellow, and the former Chairperson of the Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi; Distinguished Professor, Council of Social Development, New Delhi; Former Professor, Department of Political Science, University of Delhi.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>\"Xi Jinping Thought for the new Journey\"</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The articulation of Xi Jinping Thought at CPC's twentieth congress acquired a new sophistication and claimed more authenticity. The function of this new stress on ideology has to be understood keeping in view the stated and unstated goals of: legitimation, centralized governance, crisis management, and the great power aspirations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
