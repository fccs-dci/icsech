This is clearly reflected in the strategic documents adopted by the Kishida administration in December 2022, which authorises Japan to drastically increase defence spending, acquire counter strike capabilities and prepare a defence force which could take primary responsibility to repel an aggression. While there is broad support for the new security policies, a section of the strategic community and civil society differ with the government’s interpretation of the regional security situation and the need to increase defence spending through increased tax. They have presented counterproposals and have questioned the premise on which new security policy is based. The speaker would examine Japan’s post-Ukraine strategic doctrine, as well as alternative proposals presented by civil society groups. He would also highlight the challenges the Kishida administration would face in implementing the new security policies.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
