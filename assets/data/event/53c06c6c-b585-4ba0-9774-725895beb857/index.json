There were, however, passages in that history when transmission was not so certain, and artists developed modes of painting that put under pressure teachings and standards inherited from the past. This was the case of Zheng Xie (1693-1765) whose monochrome ink orchids were conceived as a string of tiny but effective disruptions of the technical and aesthetic principles of monochrome ink painting. Focusing on Zheng Xie’s late production, this talk explores what glitches, errors, and flaws tell us about mid-Qing artists’ attitudes toward the legacy of the past and the value they assigned to engage with a crumbling world. Michele Matteini is Assistant Professor at New York University. His book, \"A Ghost in the City: Luo Ping and the Craft of Painting in Eighteenth-Century Beijing\" is forthcoming later this year.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
