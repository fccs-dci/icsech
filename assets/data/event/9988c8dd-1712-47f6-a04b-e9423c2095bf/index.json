New frictions and differences are being brought to the fore as India and China pursue their regional interests and attempt to settle old scores. Although both leaderships have managed it delicately, it is questionable whether Delhi and Beijing can maintain such a balancing act for long. The emerging multipolar world has brought the relationship to crossroads where today’s choices will profoundly impact India’s economy, security and the regional order &amp; it is critical that India’s leaders get its China policy right.</p>\n<p>Powershift helps make sense of a complex relationship, how India and China are learning to cope with each other’s rise on the world stage and provides much-needed context for Indians to start thinking more strategically and realistically about their largest neighbour.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
