The speaker argues that the cholera pandemic was more than just a health incident in China—it was, more importantly, a significant social and political exercise. The interventionist prevention scheme, including lockdown, quarantine, isolation, mass inoculation, epidemic surveillance and information control, was affected by the social restructuring that had begun in the 1950s and was strengthened after 1961. Conversely, these interventionalist measures functionalised social control and prompted experimentation with possible alternative social structures. Therefore, they significantly contributed to the rise of an emergency disciplinary state, which exerted far-reaching impacts on socio-political systems and emergency responses.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
