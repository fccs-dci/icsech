We argue that military centralization, while strengthening a state’s ability to control the upper elites of these armed groups, can weaken the state's coercive capacity by reducing discipline and efficiency among the lower ranks in these groups. This talk studies a centralization reform in China’s Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), and finds that centralization reduced rebellions by local generals but led to more mutinies in the lower ranks of the military, more civilian uprisings, and worse battlefield performance. These findings highlight the complex effects of military centralization on the state’s coercive capacity, often overlooked in political science.
