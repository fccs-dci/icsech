Lucas has been named a Star Chef Rising Star, an Eater Young Gun, Forbes 30 under 30, and a Food and Wine Best New Chef.&nbsp;Beyond junzi and Nice Day's daily menu, Lucas curates a collaborative tasting menu exploring the narrative of Chinese culinary history in relation to other cultures of the world, which became a project known as Distance Dining during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It gives us a sense of gravityâ€”a kind of culinary mooring to people, places, and times beyond our immediate grasp. And given how rich and diverse local and regional Chinese food and practices are, tradition often serves to weave both the maker and the eater into a tapestry of past and present, intersecting and looping continuously as warp and weft.</p>\n\n<p>But what of the futures of Chinese food and foodways? How might we re-imagine the culinary, technological, ecological, and inter-communicative possibilities of Chinese food and foodways? Drawing together the experiences of a chef, cookbook author, and artist/activist/coder, this round table conversation will explore how our present shapes Chinese food futures.</p>\n\n<p>Sponsored by NEH, Emory University REALC, UNC Chapel Hill Department of History, SOAS University of London Food Studies Centre</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
