But what impact has it had on the actual lives of women in East Asia? In this webinar, Carole Petersen, a law professor and CEDAW expert at the University of Hawaii, will present a comparative case study of CEDAW’s implementation in three East Asian jurisdictions: Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. All three jurisdictions have a constitutional right to equality and well-developed economies, which should assist the governments in complying with their obligations under CEDAW. Yet the convention’s real-life impact differs significantly among the three. Professor Petersen will consider what factors may account for these differences.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
