The four dialogues will explore how flows, infrastructures, and citizenship encounter each other, and what their co-arrangements mean for the evolving nature of the state. How do flows of people, objects, and natural substances facilitate and/or obstruct the constructions of infrastructure, and vice versa? How do these flows relate similarly to constructions of citizenship? The dialogues will position a scholar of India in conversation with a scholar of China to discuss common themes in their work. The opening dialogue will lay the groundwork for the seriesâ€™ broader intellectual aims by connecting the three conceptual and empirical frameworks. The three subsequent dialogues, while still focusing on the triadic relationship between the frameworks, will emphasize each of the elements by engaging scholars of India and China who specialize in flows (for the 2nd dialogue), infrastructure (for the 3rd), and citizenship (for the 4th).</p>\n\n<p>Speakers will include Professors&nbsp;<a href=\"https://townsendmiddleton.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Townsend Middleton</a>, of the Department of Anthropology at University of North Carolina,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www2.crs.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty-staff/teaching-faculty/wu-ka-ming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ka-Ming Wu</a>, of the Cultural and Religious Studies Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/dept/hss/dr-ritajyoti-bandyopadhyay/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ritajyoti Bandyopadhyay</a>, of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.spap.ruc.edu.cn/staff/faculty1/b1002e2d6ad146668877cb8f170e87a0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yimin Zhao</a>, of the School of Urban Planning and Management at Renmin University of China,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aud.ac.in/faculty/dr-sunalini-kumar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunalini Kumar</a>, of School of Global Affairs at Ambedkar University,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/amy-zhang.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amy Zhang</a>, of the Department of Anthropology at New York University,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rvu.edu.in/team/dr-suraj-gogoi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suraj Gogoi</a>, of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences at RV University, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/sites/isp/people/faculty-profiles/andrew-grant.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrew Grant</a>, of the International Studies Program at Boston College.</p>\n\n<p>For more details about the series visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.indiachinainstitute.org/event/online-flows-infrastructure-citizenship-in-india-and-china/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ICI Events page</a>.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
