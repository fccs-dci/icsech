China’s state-run media play a crucial role in producing and distributing soft propaganda campaigns. This talk offers a glimpse of such campaigns and presents a nuanced mezzo-level analysis on the inter- and intra-organizational dynamics within the Party press system that contribute to the increasing output of soft propaganda. It shifts the emphasis from the effect of propaganda as a political instrument to the design of propaganda, which fashions an aesthetic and affective experience and opens up an ambient process of subject formation.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
