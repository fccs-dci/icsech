Marxist debates have critically looked at the CPC journey through the ideological lens, &amp; highlighted several crucial &amp; pertinent issues:<br />\na) Importance of holding on to Marxism-Leninism and never to lose the connect between the Party and the masses;<br />\n b) ideological discourse amongst Marxian schools of thought has contrasted the revolutionary founding principles with the “missing” Chinese people’s struggle against neoliberal finance;<br />\nc) last but not least, so-called “socialism with Chinese characteristics”.<br />\nAt the same time, the CPC is being analyzed in terms of the growing personality cult and larger-than-life authoritarian style of Xi Jinping, the “great leader” on one hand, and the People&#039;s Republic of China’s growing ambition to become &quot;imperial&quot; power, on the other.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
