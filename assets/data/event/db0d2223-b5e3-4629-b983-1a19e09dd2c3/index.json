Covid-19 has turned into a giant and global experiment about what that future could look like. Yet even as the present seems to offer a tantalizing thought experiment and as politicians and planners look ahead, there remain critical insights to be gleaned from the history of urban mobility and the unsustainable practices that still impact our everyday lives. Taking a leaf from the notion of the “usable past,” Oldenziel presents case studies of the book by the same title that consider the ecological, social, and economic aspects of urban mobility, showing how historical inquiry can make both conceptual and practical contributions to the projects of sustainability and urban renewal.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;,serif;mso-bidi-font-family:\nArial\">As Editor in Chief of&nbsp;<em><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;,serif;\nmso-bidi-font-family:Arial\">Technology and Culture</span></em>, she is also available for Q&amp;A about the journal.</span><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
