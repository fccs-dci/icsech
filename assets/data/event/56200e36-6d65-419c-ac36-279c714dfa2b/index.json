Youths dressed in black and wearing masks for protection against tear gas hurled paving stones and sometimes Molotov cocktails at police, who fired off tear gas, rubber bullets, and even live ammunition. At stake was Hong Kong’s future, in which many youth had lost hope. Journalists Shibani Mahtani and Timothy McLaughlin will tell the story of the protests and immediate aftermath mainly through the eyes of four participants, drawing on their new book, <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/shibani-mahtani/among-the-braves/9780306830365/\" target=\"_blank\">Among the Braves: Hope, Struggle, and Exile in the Battle for Hong Kong and the Future of Global Democracy</a>.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
