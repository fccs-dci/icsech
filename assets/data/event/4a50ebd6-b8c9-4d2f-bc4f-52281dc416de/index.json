The second session of the online lecture series &quot;Practices of Reading in the PRC&quot;, however, will try to engage both into discussion through back-to-back talks. In the first talk, Lena Henningsen will share her thoughts on intertextuality and transtextuality based on the reading of Chinese science fiction. In the second talk, Lara Yuyu Yang treats the second-hand book reading practices as mostly material-centred, and goes on to discuss the tension between materiality and digitalization in Chinaâ€™s online second-hand book reading culture.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
