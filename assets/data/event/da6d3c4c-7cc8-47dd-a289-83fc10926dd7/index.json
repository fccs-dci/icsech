Although its potential for development has been acknowledged for several years, crucial breakthroughs have remained elusive. Trade volumes which were rising from a small base have dipped and Taiwanese investments in India are nowhere near the investment flows into much smaller countries in the ASEAN region. The webinar proposes to answer several questions such as: Can India&#039;s newfound ambition to reduce economic dependency on China propel India-Taiwan economic ties to the next level? What is India&#039;s position within Taiwan&#039;s New Southbound policy? How do India&#039;s FDI and trade policies impact Taiwanese industry? Can Taiwan bridge the gaps in India&#039;s technology ecosystem? Can enhanced trade, investment and technology transfers provide a strong foundation to galvanize the entire relationship? What role do education and tourism have to play?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
