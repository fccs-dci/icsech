Nevertheless, not all investments are successful. From her ï»¿research of Chinese overseas investments in the power sector over the past two decades, Yangsiyu Lu identifies rates of power plant suspensions and where suspension rates are highest. Given the significant impacts of energy investments on the environment, Lu and her research team also explore whether environmental issues are associated with project suspensions and the locations of coal power projects and related air pollutants relative to local populations.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, November 17, join Yangsiyu Lu, a Research Fellow at the Global Development Policy Center, for a discussion on the research findings and why investors must consider environmental issues in their decision-making. This webinar is part of the Fall 2021 Global China Research Colloquium.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
