While the EU is concerned about any potential ‘divide &amp; conquer’ strategy deployed by Beijing, regional politicians have lamented the empty promises of growing Chinese investment, which have largely failed to materialize and called the 17+1 format ineffective. Debates around 5G technology add to the complexity of this situation. Lithuania already announced it is bidding farewell to the 17+1 format. Will other follow? Or will they leverage their position within the format and try to increase their appeal for Beijing? Is Central and Eastern Europe’s position on China careful or careless?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
