In regions with more canonical scholars in the ancient time, local elite built more temples to worship their classical idols, fostering a stronger classicism in the intellectual circle. The classicism stifled the diffusion of modern knowledge and human capital and, consequently, inhibited industrial development in 1858 to 1927. In contrast, industrialization achieved sustained progress in regions without such holy scholastic history.&nbsp; The findings illuminate the importance of the ‘cultural entrepreneurship’, or the lack thereof, in shaping modern economic growth.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
