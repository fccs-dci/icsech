Instead, China’s unprecedented economic growth has positioned state capitalism as a durable foil to the orthodoxy of free markets, to the confusion of many in the West. Xi Jinping was recently appointed to a third five-year term as China’s supreme leader, and has increasingly doubled down on state control of the economy and many have commented on his renewed embrace of Maoist principles. What does this mean for the future of the Chinese economy and relations with the West? What are the implications of China returning to some of the ideological principles spearheaded by Mao Zedong? And how much of China’s decades of economic success can be credited to Mao and Maoism?</p>\n\n<p>Christopher Marquis will discuss his new book, Mao and Markets (Yale University Press, 2023) which examines these questions and charts how Mao’s ideological principles, mass campaigns, and socialist institutions have enduringly influenced Chinese entrepreneurs, listed companies and provincial and city politicians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Christopher Marquis</strong>&nbsp;is the Sinyi Professor of Chinese Management at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School.
