Beyond China&#039;s borders, however, Mao&#039;s most radical international admirers were deploying the theory and practice of the Cultural Revolution in rebellions against their own states. This essay will trace the global journeys and reception of Mao&#039;s ideas, which inspired and galvanised insurgencies in Asia and Latin America that continued decades after the death of Mao and the end of the Cultural Revolution in China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
