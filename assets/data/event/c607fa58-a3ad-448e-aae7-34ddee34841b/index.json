However, the government has introduced all-encompassing maritime policies, claiming that they all play a part in the building of maritime power. Therefore, it is still unclear to us of what China’s maritime power is exactly about. In this talk, I will reveal five main objectives that have been frequently mentioned with maritime power in Chinese official documents. I suggest that China has regarded itself as building a comprehensive maritime power with the emphasis of economic, legal and technological dimensions of sea power. Additionally, I will explain the Chinese narrative of the role of navy in its maritime strategy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edward Sing Yue Chan</strong>&nbsp;is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Australian Centre on China in the World.
