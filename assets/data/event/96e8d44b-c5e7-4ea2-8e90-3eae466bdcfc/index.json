Focusing on writing as a driver for the meeting of minds and lives, understanding situations, and responsible action, the project seeks to discover narrative-based and critically focused alternatives to political quietism.<br />\nThe participants of WM projects range from artists to amateurs with no experience in practicing art and writing. WM embodies Jing’s vision of using art and documentary approaches to create &quot;self-made citizenship” in a period of political difficulty.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
