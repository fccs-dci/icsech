Despite being a &#039;rising&#039; power, there has been a visible global pushback and backlash to both China&#039;s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as well as its &quot;wolf warrior&quot; diplomacy. China has been called a &#039;lonely power&quot;, a superpower that has not actualised or may not actualise due to the gap between its economic muscle and perceived moral authority; economic power and low soft power. </p>\n<p>But today, China has a new policy thrust, a corrective to make China &quot;lovable&quot;. The effort is envisaged to rectify, correct and reverse the backlash of China&#039;s BRI, &#039;go-out&quot; policy and low soft-power. How is &quot;Lovable&quot; China manifesting in policy and practice? The genesis of why this has emerged, how China seeks to achieve this and a critique of the evolving policy will be the focus point of the paper.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
