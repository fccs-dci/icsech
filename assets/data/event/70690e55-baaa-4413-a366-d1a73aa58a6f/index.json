Does Beijing bankroll politically motivated and economically inefficient ‘‘white elephants”? What are the risks of borrowing from Beijing? The existing debate about China’s overseas lending and grant-giving activities is largely guided by opinion and conjecture rather than rigorous evidence. In this talk, Dr. Parks will set the record straight with a new dataset of international development finance from China that captures 13,427 projects worth $843 billion across 165 countries over an 18-year period.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
