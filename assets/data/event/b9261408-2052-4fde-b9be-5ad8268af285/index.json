Furthermore, the overreliance on land revenues for infrastructure finance has become a critical issue with the dimming prospects for property development, and sustainable alternative sources of finance will need to be developed.<br />\n <br />\nAgainst this background, we have chosen “China: Fiscal Policies for the New Era” as the topic for the East Asian Institute’s annual conference.  The conference will comprise of keynote speeches, academic sessions and policy panels, and is open to academics, PhD students and policy makers.</p>"}}},"context":{}}
