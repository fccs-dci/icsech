China’s re-emergence over the last few decades meant its growing influence has been felt across many dimensions by both its regional neighbors and other states. China is reshaping its relationships throughout Asia and beyond as it engages economically, diplomatically, culturally, and militarily. In recent years, critical questions on the “rise of China” have extended to concerns over whether China’s leaders will seek to alter the system in ways that favor their interests, and whether and at what point they will have the wherewithal to effect such changes. In this lecture, Professor Goh will focus on the problems of studying China’s influence in international relations.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
