Despite its staggering pollution and colossal appetite for resources, China exemplifies a model of state-led environmentalism which concentrates decisive political, economic, and epistemic power under centralized leadership. On the face of it, China seems to embody hope for a radical new approach to environmental governance.<br />\nIn their thought-provoking 2020 book, Yifei Li and Judith Shapiro probe the concrete mechanisms of China&#039;s coercive environmentalism to show how &quot;going green&quot; helps the state to further other agendas such as citizen surveillance and geopolitical influence.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
