Concerns about ethical field research and censorship pressures are not new but have been heightened by Chinaâ€™s authoritarian turn and recent events in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Not since the Vietnam War has China scholarship been so politicized. At the same time, visiting students and scholars from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the PRC on Western campuses are increasingly at odds with each other and vulnerable to censorship and doxing on social media. The pandemic has added a new dimension as classroom lectures, and discussions on digital platforms are easily recorded, making professors and students concerned about their remarks being shared beyond the classroom and taken out of context. One possibility is that students are deterred from specializing in China, reducing the ranks of expertise at a time when more, not less, knowledge about China is needed.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
