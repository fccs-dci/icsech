The dominant investments have been in infrastructure development, power plant construction and mineral extraction and processing. In a recent collaboration with the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, the Research Center for Climate Change at the University of Indonesia (RCCC-UI) conducted a spatial environmental assessment of 14 clusters of BRI projects throughout Indonesia. The research project seeks to understand the environmental and social impacts of the projects by focusing on a projectâ€™s distance from primary forest, trends of vegetation and carbon loss, emission of nitrous oxide (NOx) as a dangerous air pollutant, the presence of selected endangered species and the presence of affected Indigenous Peoples.</p>\n\n<p>Join us on Wednesday, April 20, for a discussion on the spatial environmental assessment of select BRI projects in Indonesia, featuring Rebecca Ray and University of Indonesia researchers Albertus Hadi Pramono, Masita Dwi Mandini Manessa, Mochamad Indrawan and Dwi Amalia Sari. This webinar is part of the Spring 2022 Global China Research Colloquium.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
