However, what remains unclear is how defensive is the concept of active defence? ‘Active defence’ calls for the People’s Liberation Army to ‘not attack unless attacked, but surely counterattack when attacked’. Therefore, one cannot ignore the scope or potential of ‘pre-emption’ in the case of China. Simply put, Beijing’s growing military capabilities and quest for power projection suggest an ‘offensive’ intent—an ability to attack and not just respond when attacked. As noted, in the form of recent Chinese military activism in the Taiwan Straits against US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August. In this context, it becomes imperative to decode the underpinnings of ‘active defence’ in China’s Military Strategy.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
