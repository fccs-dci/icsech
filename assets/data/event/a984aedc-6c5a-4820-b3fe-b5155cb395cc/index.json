My study was interested in how educational mobility affects post-90s middle-class women’s negotiations of the contradictory gendered life scripts and self-understandings available to them today. One of the study’s premises was the observation of a tension in contemporary Chinese public culture between, on the one hand, a neoliberal-style discourse of self-reliant, self-entrepreneurial professional subjecthood that has strong interpellative power for well-resourced, middle-class, urban singleton daughters; and, on the other hand, a neotraditionalist discourse of women’s inherently family-centred “nature” and their biological destiny to marry and have a child(ren) by age thirty. </span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-indent:.5in\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The research reveals an overseas-graduate subjectivity marked by decreasing identification with the neotraditionalist model of femininity, and correspondingly increased identification with mobile enterprising selfhood. Broadly, graduates emerged as market subjects: a willingly mobile labour force suited in terms of ideological orientation and self-understanding, as well as concrete skills, to work in the engine rooms of global capitalism as financiers, professionals, and high-level technicians. This broad tendency, however, is attended by multiple complexities connected with the women’s situations vis-à-vis class, gender, family, work, and mobility itself, which I will explore in this presentation through selected participant stories.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-indent:.5in\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">(Note: Access to recordings will be only available to registrants.)&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
