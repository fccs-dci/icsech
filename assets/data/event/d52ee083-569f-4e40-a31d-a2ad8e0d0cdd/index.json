In the US, business leaders talk about promoting “stakeholder capitalism” over “shareholder capitalism.” Law Professors Gen Goto and Curtis J. Milhaupt will discuss the similarities and differences between these two sets of ideas and the implications for corporate governance and society.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
