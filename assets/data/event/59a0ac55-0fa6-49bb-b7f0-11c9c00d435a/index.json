While Deng's era marked a political breakthrough for China's adoption of an incremental path to liberalization, President Jiang Zemin is known for his bold approach to neoliberal market reforms. Most of the measures pertaining to the transformation of SOEs into modern enterprises were taken by Jiang Zemin's leadership (1993-2003). The talk will detail the nuances of state-market relations under Jiang Zemin through an analysis of state enterprise management. It will shed light on Jiang's theory of 'three represents' and how he sought to replace the idea of class warfare by providing a neo-utilitarian justification for his reform agenda.&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
