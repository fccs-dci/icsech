For three decades, Hong Kong people have struggled for democracy so as to preserve their preexisting freedoms. Chinese leaders, on the other hand, have tried to make Hong Kong safe for the Chinese Communist Party. The national security law aims to kill Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy. Hong Kong people have vowed to fight on to prevent the city’s further descent into Tibet or Xinjiang. Hong Kong is a global city and its fate shapes the future of the world order. American students can help by supporting Congressional acts and government policies that protect Hong Kongers.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
