Lu Xun, fearing rebuke and rejection from traditional literary scholars, chose Ba Ren (巴人 or commoner) as the pseudonym to hide his identity and protect his literary image. He was overwhelmed when the series became a sensation among people from all walks of life. During the past century, scholars and critics in China, Japan and the West, have relentlessly upheld &#039;The True Story of Ah Q&#039; as not only Lu Xun’s best but also modern China’s most soul-stirring, most condescending to traditional Confucian values, most politically sensitive, most pro-people, most anti-feudal and anti-rulers, most anti-revolution Revolutionary, most anti-modern Modernist, most anti-Classics classic, most “ordinary” and most tragic work of fiction. This Conference will examine questions which need to be addressed in order to objectively analyse and evaluate Lu Xun, Ah Q, and the future of China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
