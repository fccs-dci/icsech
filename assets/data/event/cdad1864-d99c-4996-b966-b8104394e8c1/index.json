It announced plans to double defense-related expenditures to equal 2 percent of GDP in five years and updated three of its key national security documents. Meanwhile, Japan and the US have strengthened their alliance through a Biden-Kishida summit at the White House and a series of meetings between their top economic policy and security/defense teams. What is Japan’s goal, and what other steps may be necessary to harden the resilience of its supply chains for goods, energy, and food? Professor Kanehara of Doshisha University, who helped formulate security policy while serving as assistant chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from 2012 to 2019, will discuss the role Japan should play in the alliance with the US and share his comprehensive view of security from a geopolitical perspective.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
