This talk will present two cases showcasing the application of AI models in historical research. Employing generative large language models, the first case uses AI agents to reenact intellectual debates in Chinese history. The second case uses embedding models to quantify psychological constructs in historical texts and explores the evolution of cultural psychology in premodern China over the course of two millennia.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong>Time:</strong> 7–8 p.m. (US Eastern Time), Wednesday, September 18, 2024</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong>Zoom Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://bucknell.zoom.us/j/95719804854?pwd=3OIQaJJv7gR9AqRCV2vPc8yRR07624.1\">https://bucknell.zoom.us/j/95719804854?pwd=3OIQaJJv7gR9AqRCV2vPc8yRR07624.1</a></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>(Meeting ID: 957 1980 4854; Password: cbdb)</span></span></p>"}}},"context":{}}
