These policies were supported by the interests of both American businesses and academics. In addition to direct economic interest, that relationship was driven by the expectation that robust economic ties would lead to \"convergence\" of the two economies through intensive economic and cultural engagement.<br />\n<br />\nIn recent years, the two nations have not become much alike and today confront growing tensions in their relationship. These tensions have reached a sufficient level for policymakers and government officials to argue in favor of “decoupling” or the termination of the mutually beneficial economic relationship to contain China’s growth particularly in high tech regime and global leadership. Advocates for decoupling have become increasingly vocal and enjoy great support in the U.S. Congress and Administration.<br />\n<br />\nThe U.S. now faces a major policy challenge to limit the U.S.-China economic relationship or to continue along the current path to continue to secure the substantial economic benefits and, possibly, mitigate future conflict through continued shared interest.<br />\n<br />\nOur three speakers Ed Monser, Joel Glassman, and Hung-Gay Fung will discuss various issues related to the possible decoupling of the U.S.-China relationship as the two nations enter a period of intense competition.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
