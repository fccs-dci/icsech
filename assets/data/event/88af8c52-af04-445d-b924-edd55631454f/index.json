China reformed many of its laws and practices, encouraged its lawyers and academics to develop expertise in the WTO regime, and became an experienced user of WTO dispute settlement. Fast forward to the present, we find the WTO and multilateral trade system in crisis, its contribution to the rule of law regarded with skepticism both in China and in other leading WTO member states such as the United States. Professor Manjiao Chi of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and Professor Kathleen Claussen of the University of Miami Law School will discuss the current attitudes within China towards the WTO, particularly when compared to regional trade agreements initiatives and alternatives to WTO dispute settlement; whether China still regards the WTO as important; and what WTO reforms China wants.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
