Many nations have enacted or are considering a range of measures, including pursuing cross-border collaborations for a consistent approach. Concerns about the risks and harms of AI technology are wide-ranging, including fairness, privacy, safety, and transparency. Regulatory discussions are correspondingly complex, touching on values such as human rights, democracy, and sustainability. Professor Hiroki Habuka of the Kyoto University Graduate School of Law and Professor Daniel Francis of NYU School of Law will use the current Japanese approach to AI regulation as a framework to explore some of the big questions that AI presents to legislators, citizens, and regulatory theorists. Bruce Aronson will be the moderator.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
