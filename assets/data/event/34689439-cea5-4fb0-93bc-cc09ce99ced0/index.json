Prior to his sudden entry into politics, he was Prosecutor General of South Korea and his experience in politics is quite limited. There are speculations about his leadership as well as his policies. He gave several bold and provocative statements during his election campaign but it would be interesting to see whether he moves ahead in accordance to his past utterances or he moderates his postures.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, he intends to bring a shift away from the previous administration’s foreign policy. He has promised to bring more warmth in the country’s relationship with the US and improve South Korea’s relationship with Japan. His statements that South Korea would invite more THAAD batteries as well as American tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea have annoyed China and it would be important to see if Yoon Suk-yeol’s approach causes economic and other repercussions for South Korea’s relations with China. The new President of South Korea would also look for more reciprocity in the inter-Korea relations and there are apprehensions that inter-Korea relations may remain stagnant during his tenure. Unlike the Moon Jae-in administration, the current administration appears to be more overt in its support to Indo-Pacific strategy and not averse to becoming a member of the Quad. Moon Jae-in preferred to work through New Southern Policy in the region but Yoon Suk-yeol preferences appear to be different. Thus, in the changing Indo-Pacific, the foreign policy orientation of the new administration of South Korea would be quite important. The proposed deliberation is meant to decipher and understand Yoon Suk-yeol administration’s foreign policy approach and its implications for the region.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
