For decades, scientific exchange has been an effective vehicle for sustained interaction among nations, even during periods of heightened diplomatic tensions. The ocean and atmospheric sciences, in particular, have long been areas of vibrant international collaboration, because the effective understanding of the physics of the world&#039;s oceans, climate and weather patterns, and the associated impacts to life on our planet, requires measurement and modeling programs that cross political boundaries and span vast distances. We will discuss some of these programs, with a particular focus on collaborations between UH-Mānoa and Chinese institutions.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
