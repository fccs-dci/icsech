US law requires a majority of employees to support union representation before a company is required to negotiate with the union. That results in high-profile unionization campaigns like those taking place at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks stores.&nbsp; By contrast, employers in Japan must bargain in good faith with minority unions, sometimes more than one at a workplace.&nbsp; How does this affect unionization and collective bargaining, and what are the implications for the future of labor markets in Japan and the US?&nbsp; Two leading experts on labor law, Professor Hiroya Nakakubo of Hitotsubashi University and Professor Alan Hyde of Rutgers Law School, will join NYU Law Adjunct Professor Bruce Aronson in discussion.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
