Whether Cross-Strait relations improve in future depends on policies adopted by PRC, Taiwan &amp; to some extent, USA. Thus, delineating strategic currents in the Cross-straits relations requires an analysis of dynamics in the Indo-Pacific along with the development of Taiwan as a resilient stakeholder in the context of post-Covid 19 pandemic recovery. With Beijing unlikely to soften its demand that Taiwanese leaders recognize that Taiwan is a part of China, China will step up actions to coerce &amp; isolate Taiwan. Democracies should make greater efforts unilaterally &amp; multilaterally to support Taiwan, to strengthen deterrence. The speakers will discuss the implications for the region and where Indiaâ€™s interests lie.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
