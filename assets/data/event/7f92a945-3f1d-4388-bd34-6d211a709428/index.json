After a year of large and sometimes violent protests, China imposed a national security law on the semi-autonomous city in late June. Under the sweeping legislation, Chinaâ€™s security agencies can now operate openly in Hong Kong, and critics, including those abroad, can face charges for acts and even statements deemed as promoting secession or foreign interference.This talk will examine how the security law came to be, and how Hong Kong has changed since it was enacted.
