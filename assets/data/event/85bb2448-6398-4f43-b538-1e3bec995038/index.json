The analysis reveals significant shifts in both the thematic focus of discussions surrounding socialist ideology and sentiments towards Soviet Union within Chinese official discourse over the socialist era. Notably, the distribution of discussion topics concerning the USSR appears to have been primarily influenced by China’s domestic political dynamics. Conversely, the sentiments expressed towards the USSR reflect a broader diplomatic spectrum, encompassing expressions of friendship, debates, conflicts, and instances of reconciliation between the two nations.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaker Bio:<br />\nDr.&nbsp;Qiang&nbsp;Fu&nbsp;is an Associate Professor of Sociology and a co-director of the Centre for Chinese Research at the University of British Columbia.
