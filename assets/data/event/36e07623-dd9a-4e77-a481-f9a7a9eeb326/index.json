Book reviews are helpful, but take months or even years to come out. To make it easier for China scholars to discuss with each other some of the recent English-language books they are reading, the University of Washington China Studies Program has started a virtual China Studies Book Club. We think it will be fun to have conversations about books we find exciting, provocative, or moving and invite China scholars elsewhere to join us.<br />\nSecond Meeting â€“ April 13: Chris Courtney, The Nature of Disaster in China: The 1931 Yangzi River Flood (Dec 19, 2019). 304 pages.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
