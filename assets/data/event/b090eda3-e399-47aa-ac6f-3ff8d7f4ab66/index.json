It’s an incredibly diverse area, both naturally, and culturally, as a home to many of China’s minority groups.<br />\nFor this event, we are proud to be partnering with our friends at Global Heritage Fund to hear about their work in Guizhou’s rural Dali Dong village. Since 2012, Global Heritage Fund has been working with local institutions and NGOs to promote community and economic development in this area through heritage conservation within ethnic minority communities. Part of this effort included a collaboration with Beijing’s Studio Atlas in order to platform the hand-made indigo textiles unique to the Dong minority – both to preserve this ancient tradition and to make it accessible in the modern-day market across China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
