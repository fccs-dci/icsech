While the United States and South Korea’s economic relationship has remained relatively strong amid the disputes on trade and defense cost, it faces new challenges. Geopolitical uncertainty, enduring impacts of the century’s worst virus outbreak, and the rise of digital power indicate it is time to review the current economic relationship between the US and South Korea. What will the future hold? Will the new administration focus on a holistic and multilateral approach towards East Asia or on a narrower bilateral relationship with each country? How will South Korea be affected by the US-China relationship? What is South Korea’s role? Can the new administration advance the current relationship with South Korea within the next four years? Join our discussion with experts on the prospects of the countries&#039; economic relationship under the Biden administration.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
