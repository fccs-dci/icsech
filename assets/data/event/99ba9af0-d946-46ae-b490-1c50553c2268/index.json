Seeking to extend the idea of object-centered research to spatial analysis, the workshop invites discussion of how landscapes may be engaged to generate their own stories, and how this, in turn, may aid in countering dominant narratives in our studies of art and architecture.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
