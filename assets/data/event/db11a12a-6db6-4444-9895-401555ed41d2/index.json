CEAS Author Talks series, this event features Professor Peggy Wang&#039;s recent publication. During the 1980s and 1990s, a group of Chinese artists (Zhang Xiaogang, Wang Guangyi, Sui Jianguo, Zhang Peili, and Lin Tianmiao) ascended to new heights of international renown. Professor Wang offers a corrective to previous appraisals, demonstrating how their works address fundamental questions about the forms, meanings, and possibilities of art. This book focuses on methods of interpretation and narratives of agency, and speaks to Professor Wang&#039;s inquiries into what it means for histories of contemporary art—and Art History more generally—to be inclusive.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
