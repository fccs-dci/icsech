Yet meaningful anti-corruption efforts by nondemocratic governments are more common and more often successful than is widely assumed. In this talk, Carothers draws on extensive documentary research to argue that Xi Jinping’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign in China, despite its limitations, has been effective at curbing bribery, embezzlement, and other illicit practices since 2012. Moreover, although corruption control is often thought to rely on democratic or quasi-democratic institutions constraining power, Xi’s campaign has succeeded through a top-down, authoritarian approach. The outcomes of this signature Xi policy, Carothers explains, hold broader implications for our thinking about China’s future direction. This talk is based on Carothers’ book <em>Corruption Control in Authoritarian Regimes: Lessons From East Asia</em>, which is forthcoming from Cambridge University Press in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Christopher Carothers is a political scientist conducting research on authoritarian politics with a regional focus on China and East Asia.
