Professor Gries addressed this question in a webinar last May, and will revisit it in this October talk, more than nine months after COVID-19 first emerged in China.</p>\n<p>Since May, US-China relations have further deteriorated, shifting from geopolitical to ideological competition. If a ‘Beijing Consensus’ of Authoritarian Capitalism is pit against a ‘Washington Consensus’ of Liberal Democracy, there will be few winners in a 21st Century Cold War. Much will depend on the results of the US presidential election in November, and whether the Xi administration continues to double down on its “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
