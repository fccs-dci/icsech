The general consensus is that the evolution of China’s BIT regime has its underlying logic, which follows an investment liberalization trend and fits China’s changing role from a key capital-importing state to a major capital-exporting state. A similar trend is evident in Chinese BIT-making and BIT policy. In this talk, Professor Shen Wei investigates these theoretical assumptions and looks into some of the loopholes in Chinese BITs.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
