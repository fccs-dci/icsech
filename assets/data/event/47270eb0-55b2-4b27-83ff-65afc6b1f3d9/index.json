Drawing on a broad range of German, English, Japanese and Chinese primary sources, including business records, government documents and personal papers, Moazzin reconstructs how during this period foreign banks facilitated China’s financial integration into the first global economy and provided the financial infrastructure required for modern economic globalization in China. Foreign Banks and Global Finance in Modern China shows the key role international finance and foreign banks and capital markets played at important turning points in modern Chinese history.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,serif\">(<em><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,serif\">Hong Kong Takes Flight: Commercial Aviation and the Making of a Global Hub, 1930s–1998</span></em>)</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,serif\">Commercial aviation took shape in Hong Kong as the city developed into a powerful economy. Rather than accepting air travel as an inevitability in the era of global mobility, John Wong argues that Hong Kong’s development into a regional and global airline hub was not preordained. By underscoring the shifting process through which this hub emerged, _Hong Kong Takes Flight_ aims to describe globalization and global networks in the making. Viewing the globalization of the city through the prism of its airline industry, Wong examines how policymakers and businesses asserted themselves against international partners and competitors in a bid to accrue socioeconomic benefits, negotiated their interests in Hong Kong’s economic success, and articulated their expressions of modernity.</span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
