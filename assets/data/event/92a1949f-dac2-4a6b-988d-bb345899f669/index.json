Cohen, and his unique contributions to U.S.-Asia mutual understanding and cooperation in the field of law. This year has marked Jerry Cohen’s 90th birthday and his official retirement from teaching at NYU – although not his retirement from writing, speaking, advocacy, and devotion to the U.S.-Asia Law Institute.<br />\nIn his honor, we are holding an online forum to discuss the Asian-related topics most dear to his heart: public international law, rule of law, human rights, and criminal justice. Multiple generations of students, colleagues, and friends will join him in conversation.<br />\nWe also will update friends of USALI about the Institute’s ongoing work and plans for the future. We look forward to seeing you on October 6!</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
