A Chinese economist educated both in the U.S. and China, Dr. Jin is currently an associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics and a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. She specializes in international macroeconomics and the Chinese economy.<br />\n<br />\n“The biggest geopolitical change of the twenty-first century will be the end of exclusive Western political and economic dominance. The rise of China is at the core of this change and Keyu Jin is a brilliant thinker to take us through its implications from the perspectives of someone who understands both China and the West. It is this combination of insider and outsider insight that makes The New China Playbook essential reading.\"<br />\n—Tony Blair, former prime minister of the United Kingdom<br />\n<br />\n“Keyu Jin is one of the most extraordinary young economists I have ever encountered.”<br />\n–Larry Summers, Former Secretary of the Treasury and President of Harvard<br />\n<br />\nThis special event is made possible though the collaborative efforts of the US Heartland China Association, Global Minnesota, and the China US Exchange Foundation.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
