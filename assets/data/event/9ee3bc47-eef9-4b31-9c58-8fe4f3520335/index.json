Female legislators have consistently held about 20% of seats in the NPC in the past two decades because of a gender quota, but they sponsor about 44% of all legislative bills and more than half of bills relevant to women&#039;s rights and interests in the 12th NPC. Among sponsors, women on average sponsor more bills (4.8 bills) than men (3.1 bills). They propose three potential mechanisms that drive women&#039;s comparative productiveness.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
