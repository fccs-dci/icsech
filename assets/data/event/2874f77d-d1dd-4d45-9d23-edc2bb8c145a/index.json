Where some see a competition, others see a renewed form of Cold War. At stake may be the future of important struts of the current multilateral system, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). This event will address the current state and future of the US-China trade relationship. It will consist of a dialogue between two leading US trade academics. Professor Gregory Shaffer, president-elect of the American Society of International Law, will discuss his latest article, appearing soon in the American Journal of International Law.
