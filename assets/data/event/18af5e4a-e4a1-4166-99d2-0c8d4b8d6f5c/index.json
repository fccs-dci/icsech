Is the Indo-Pacific strategy inclusive or divisive for the region? Will the Biden administration achieve its objectives outlined in the strategy? How have regional countries responded to the strategy so far?</p>\n\n<p>This presentation will critically examine the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy and discuss its inherent contradictions. Countries in the region have reacted differently, with many of them hedging and balancing between the United States and China, which suggests that it will not be easy for the Biden administration to achieve its objectives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the speaker</strong></p>\n\n<p>Zhiqun Zhu is Professor of Political Science and International Relations at Bucknell University.
