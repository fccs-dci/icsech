Yet Sayrāmī’s work is also a multilayered transcultural text that advances insightful observations of Chinese power and new theories about its workings. This talk places the Tārīkh-i Ḥamīdī into its social and cultural context of late-Qing Inner Asia, when a group of Confucian activists engaged in a civilizing project meant to incorporate this Muslim-majority borderland and its people into the Chinese ecumene.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
