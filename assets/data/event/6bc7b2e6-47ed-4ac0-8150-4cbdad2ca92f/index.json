Gelatt Dialogue on the Rule of Law in East Asia: Climate Change in Asia-Pacific</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1647276975017_295\">Panel 1: Climate Governance and the Rule of Law</h2>\n\n<p>The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that the damage to Earth’s ecosystems from rising temperatures is mounting far more rapidly than the global community has been able to respond – at least, so far. With an updated and comprehensive climate treaty seemingly out of reach, what are other options for mobilizing action? Our expert panel, which includes two authors of the upcoming IPCC Working Group III report, will discuss the prospects for alternative approaches including multilayered efforts at the level of regional groups of states, domestic governments, and sub-national governments, as well as pursuing agreements on single issues, in single sectors, or among non-state actors such as businesses.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
