Why did federalism fail as a political program in Republican China? What role did the historical precedents of Chinese political thought play in the reception and articulation of federalism? And finally, what legacy does the “federal failure” still play today, after one century, in the (contested) definition of the relationship between centre and peripheries in the People’s Republic of China?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
