Yet examinations of individual communities and persons in the frontier demonstrate overarching vacillations of political sovereignties and varied m√©langes of cultural practices. This lecture engages historical and archaeological discussions of the Southern Xiongnu (ca.50-200 CE) as one example of local leaders who navigated their presence between exterior competing regimes through a suite of hybrid cultural mediations to successfully maintain independent political power.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
