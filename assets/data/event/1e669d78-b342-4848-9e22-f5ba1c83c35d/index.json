What counts as effective knowledge? In the West, public awareness of China is high and rising, perception about China is divided and even polarized, but knowledge about China is limited. How should we understand these changes, and how should we respond? In particular, what can we do in order to make China studies more interactive and communicative – to communicate to the divided public and with stakeholders, including those in China, more effectively? This will require new ways of doing research and presenting knowledge.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
