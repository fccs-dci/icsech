Notwithstanding its previous policy of “strategic ambiguity,” President Biden has reiterated that the US would “defend Taiwan” if Beijing resorted to the military to enforce Taiwan reunification On its part, Beijing has been consistently responding to provocations coming from US officials with strident remarks of their own and by sending dozens of warplanes over Taiwan’s air defense zone. Additionally, China’s increasing diplomatic and military assertiveness in the South China Sea and South Pacific is a matter of concern. The policy of strategic competition between the US and China is embedded in the structural factors. It is in this backdrop this seminar will look at the evolving narrative over the Taiwan issue in the China-US relations and implications for the region.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
