Co-authored by Sophia Gaston, Director of the British Foreign Policy Centre, and Rana Mitter, Professor of the History and Politics of Modern China at Oxford University, the report explores the ways in which the UK state, businesses, education institutions and citizens will need to strengthen their resilience to China’s influence and potential incursions, while also setting out the productive forms of engagement that could continue to flourish between Britain and China in the future. In this special event, the authors Sophia Gaston and Rana Mitter will be in conversation with Professor Todd Hall, Director of the University of Oxford China Centre.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
