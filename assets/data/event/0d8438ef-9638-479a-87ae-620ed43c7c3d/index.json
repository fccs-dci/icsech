To kick off 2024, USHCA will partner with the Carter Center to invite Ker Gibbs to discuss his recent book \"Selling to China: Stories of Success, Failure, and Constant Change\". As past president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Ker has a wealth of experience in navigating the complexities of the Chinese business landscape, as well as important strategies, trends, and success stories that will empower attendees to make informed decisions and forge successful partnerships in the Peopleâ€™s Republic.<br />\n<br />\nSelling to China offers a rational voice of reason from a time when the intermeshed economies of the U.S. and China are increasingly at odds, and all the while compliance laws become more and more opaque. Don't miss this opportunity to better understand entry into one of the world's largest and most influential markets. USHCA and Carter Center members will also be able to stay on after the event for a special opportunity to talk to Ker about insights into the intricacies of requirements for selling products and services in China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
