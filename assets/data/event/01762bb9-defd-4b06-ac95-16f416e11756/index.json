Young party members were encouraged to live as cogs in the machine of the Yan&#039;an Rectification Movement. This paper attempts to illustrate some changes which occurred in the inner psychological world of young female Communists, in the marriage customs involving male cadres, and in the world of literature by using materials such as the diary of Mao Dun&#039;s daughter Shen Xia.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
