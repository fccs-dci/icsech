When the pandemic began in 2020, Europe was China’s largest trading partner and Chinese investment into Europe was surging. Even then, however, European FDI into China was in a slump due to frustration with market access. China has since liberalized its investment rules for some sectors. Will that be enough to revive European interest? Or have the combined effects of China’s long Covid lockdowns and Washington’s concerns about China as a security threat caused European business to chill on China and shift their sights elsewhere?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
