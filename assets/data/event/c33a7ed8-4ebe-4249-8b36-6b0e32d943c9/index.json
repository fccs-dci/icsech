Ying Bai of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and his co-authors investigate this question by analyzing how exposure to Communist ideology shaped an individual’s decision to join the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during its formative stage. Their study focuses on cadets at the Whampoa Military Academy, who played crucial roles in China’s major 20th-century conﬂicts. Their identiﬁcation strategy leverages the locality-time-content variation in the circulation of the New Youth magazine—the primary platform promoting Communism following the Treaty of Versailles in 1919—and the variation in an individual’s location over time. Comparing Whampoa cadets living in a locality with access to post-1919 New Youth against those who lived in the same locality but missed this channel, they ﬁnd that the former were signiﬁcantly more likely to join the CCP, and that this party choice was consequential in subsequent conﬂicts. They also ﬁnd that family background did not predict party choice, but that social networks complemented ideology exposure. In this Quantitative History Webinar, Ying Bai will present their analyses of other periodicals and organizations that support post-1919 New Youth’s role as a proxy for Communism penetration in a locality.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
