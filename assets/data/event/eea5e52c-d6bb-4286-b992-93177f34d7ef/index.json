While leading reformers reached the consensus that Western science should be incorporated into the essential curriculum of the new national school system and tested in the civil service examination, Zhang Zhidong 張之洞 (1837-1909) and Yan Fu went even further to express opposing views over the issue of whether Western science should be viewed as a cultural authority “to take precedence over China’s dogma.” By making visible the little-known fact that Zhang Zhidong rejected Yan Fu’s concept of “Western gezhi” and advocated “Western mechanical arts” (xiyi 西藝) instead, this article calls readers’ attention to the eve of the historic breakthrough before On Heavenly Evolution convinced Chinese literati to treat Western science as a cultural authority. When On Heavenly Evolution—being perceived as a text of “Western gezhi”—rose in importance to become the most influential book of modern Chinese thought, science finally acquired the prestigious position of cultural authority that Matteo Ricci had envisioned for it in the 17th century, and began to exercise a previously unimaginable influence in 20th century China.</p>\n\n<p>Situating this Chinese debate in the context of the rise of the globally circulating conception of “Western science” in the late 19th Century, this article foregrounds the crucial importance of investigating how non-Europeans responded to the primacy of science relative to technology that was taken for granted in that conception.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
