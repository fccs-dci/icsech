Modern nation-states are based on principles of territoriality and sovereignty, while the principle and practice of reincarnation defies both. Yet, as the Tibet question in contemporary international relations highlights, matters of emanation, reincarnation, and so on, go beyond Buddhism and religious scholarship. The talk will analyse the modern incarnation of the reincarnation/tulku system, both in China-controlled Tibet (proliferation of “living Buddhas”, domestication of the practice to allow only “patriotic” lamas) and in exile. While identifying tensions between sacrality and temporality when it comes to reincarnation in Tibetan Buddhism within the wider contexts of China-Tibetan, China-India (including border relations) and China-West relations, the talk will also analyse the (im)possibility of reconciling traditional fluid non-modern ideas (such as reincarnation) with modern secularist ideas and practices of politics and international relations.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
