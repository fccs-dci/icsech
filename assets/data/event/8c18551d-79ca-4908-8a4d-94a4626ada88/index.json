This understanding has become increasingly dominated by narratives of the urban sustainability fix, which stresses the logic of capital accumulation. Within the broader structural processes of ecological modernization (e.g., low‐carbon growth), consideration of—let alone interest in—the diversity of local politics that shapes the practice and forms of contestation of eco‐urbanism has often been relegated to a position of secondary importance. Drawing on a detailed case study of the prevalence of zero‐waste neighborhood experiments in many Chinese cities, this article underscores the potential of grassroots activism to change the nature, dynamics and landscape of eco‐urbanism significantly. It calls for a new understanding of eco‐urbanism: one which is more attentive to the diversity, heterogeneity and contextual sensitivity of urban change at the grassroots level.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
