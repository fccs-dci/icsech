CEAS Author Talks series, this event features Michigan State University&#039;s Xuefei Ren, and her book, &quot;Governing the Urban in China and India: Land Grabs, Slum Clearance, and the War on Air Pollution.&quot; Urbanization is rapidly overtaking China and India, the two most populous countries in the world. One-sixth of humanity now lives in either a Chinese or Indian city. This transformation has unleashed enormous pressures on land use, housing, and the environment. Despite the stakes, the workings of urban governance in China and India remain obscure and poorly understood. Professor Ren&#039;s book explores how the two countries govern their cities and how their different styles of governance produce inequality and exclusion. This program also features University of Chicago&#039;s Marco Garrido as Discussant.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
