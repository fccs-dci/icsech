Examining the personal writings of male elites and physiognomy manuals, Dr. Lu focuses on the physical construct and political image that physiognomists designed for Zhu Di, a body that manifested the “dragon form.” The lecture hopes to reveal how the literary tradition in China influenced and conditioned methods of imperial propaganda.
