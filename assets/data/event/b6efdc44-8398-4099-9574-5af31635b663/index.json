By exploring both narrative and ritual sources from the modern era (16th-20th century), we will see that these ritual techniques promote a process of subjectivation in both humans and non-humans. It is as subjects that humans and their usually invisible interlocutors can form bonds and social networks. We will see, through the case of spirit-writing cults, how Social Network Analysis (SNA) extended to spirits allows us to think afresh the question of the status of non-humans in China and beyond.</p>"}}},"context":{}}
