In introducing these collectors, the talk will seek to make two arguments. The first is that these collections and the motivations of those who collect them are much more varied and diverse than most of the academic literature has hitherto acknowledged. The talk will present a history of the field and through tracing the emergence of the field of collecting from the 1980s onwards, will argue that any critical potential the field may have initially embodied has been eliminated through its gradual professionalisation. In parallel with this, the self-identity of the collectors has risen, with collectors now seeing themselves as patriotic members of the cultural elite, and as transmitters of history, culture and ‘positive energy’ to the younger generation.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
