However, two formidable states, namely China and India, have been among the ones resisting the need to “take sides” in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.&nbsp; At a time when the capacity for effective UN Security Council responses, even in response to aggression, seems stymied, how should we understand the posture of China and India in response to Ukraine and other formidable global challenges, including climate change?&nbsp; This is the rare opportunity to engage in conversation with a leading UN insider – at a time when the UN faces what some consider to be an “existential crisis.”</p>\n\n<p><em><u><strong>About the speaker</strong></u></em></p>\n\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1666130192445_251\"><a href=\"https://www.iilj.org/people/david-malone/\">Dr. David M.
