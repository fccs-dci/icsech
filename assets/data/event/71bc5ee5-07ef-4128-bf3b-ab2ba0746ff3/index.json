It is a major plank in China&#039;s geo-strategic and economic architecture in the region. Pakistan&#039;s economic distress, friction with Washington in recent years &amp; its tensions with India, provide Beijing an opportunity to draw Pakistan closer. It is increasingly clear that Pakistan will pay a high price in terms of its sovereignty and economic costs. China intends to use Pakistan to hem India within South Asia and limit its elbow room in IOR. CPEC is viewed by Balochs as an endeavour to exploit Balochistan&#039;s natural resources at the cost of the locals, spurring insurgency. The opaque nature of the CPEC &amp; its geostrategic underpinnings detract vastly from any economic growth and development that it may deliver.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
