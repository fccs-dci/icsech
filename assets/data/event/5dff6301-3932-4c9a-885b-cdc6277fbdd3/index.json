The analysis reveals that only half of the designated successors in the two millennia of imperial Chinese history successfully ascended to power. These divergent outcomes are best explained by the age of the ruling monarch, the age gap between the ruling monarch and the designated successor, and the presence or absence of powerful officials at court. These findings the conventional wisdom that uses primogeniture to explain political succession and instead emphasizes the influence of non-institutional factors.
