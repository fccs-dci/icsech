This webinar presents research from two recently published studies of language and linguistic change in Tibetan parts of China examining but two of the sixty minority Tibetan languages. Gerard Roche will speak about the local dynamics threatening Manegacha, spoken by about 8,000 people who are otherwise mostly indistinguishable from the Tibetan communities surrounding them. Shannon Ward will talk about her research into how children in Amdo (mainly coterminous with contemporary Qinghai) are reformatting their linguistic associations of culture, place, and kinship as they build peer relationships in their Chinese-speaking school environment.</h3>\n\n<p>The book titled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501777783/the-politics-of-language-oppression-in-tibet/#bookTabs=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Politics of Language Oppression in Tibet</em></a><em><em>&nbsp;</em></em>(Cornell University Press) explores the state policies and everyday practices that are driving the ongoing destruction of linguistic diversity across the Tibetan Plateau in the People's Republic of China. The book focuses on Manegacha, which is but one of the sixty minority languages in Tibet and is spoken by about 8,000 people who are otherwise mostly indistinguishable from the Tibetan communities surrounding them. Recently, many in these communities have switched to speaking Tibetan, and Manegacha faces an uncertain future. In addition to examining the local dynamics threatening Manegacha and other languages in Tibet, the book also looks at how global advocacy networks inadequately acknowledge this issue, highlighting the complex politics of language in an inter-connected world.</p>\n\n<p>The book titled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://utorontopress.com/9781487558673/amdo-lullaby/?srsltid=AfmBOopMcSgejLFa18aBwUUhJaK9EvQiQ9jjAJ_DK2_bHxe8JIJq3InK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Amdo Lullaby: An Ethnography of Childhood and Language Shift on the Tibetan Plateau</em></a>&nbsp;examines the language socialization trajectories of rural and urban children, in Amdo, Tibet. Amdo is a region of eastern Tibet incorporated into mainland China, where Chinese state development policies are catalysing rural to urban migration, consolidating schooling in urban centres, and leading Tibetan farmers and nomads to give up their traditional livelihoods. As a result, children face increasing pressure to adopt the state's official language of Mandarin. By integrating a fine-grained analysis of everyday conversations and oral history interviews, this book reveals that young children are not passively abandoning their mother tongue for standard Mandarin, but instead are reformatting traditional Amdo Tibetan cultural associations among language, place, and kinship as they build their peer relationships in everyday play.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speakers</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Gerald Roche,&nbsp;</strong></strong>Associate Professor of Politics at La Trobe University.
