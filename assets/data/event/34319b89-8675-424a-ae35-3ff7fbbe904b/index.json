Dr. Sicular’s estimates using this definition show the dramatic emergence of China’s middle class, which rose from only 2% of the population in 2007 to 25% in 2018, and which holds implications for China and the world.<br />\nTerry Sicular is Professor of Economics at Western University (Canada). She is a leading North American expert on the Chinese economy. In recent years she has been involved with the China Household Income Project, an ongoing household survey research project, and her research has focused on topics related to household incomes, inequality, poverty, the middle class, and education in China.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
