Understanding who we are as a country is a crucial first step to the U.S. building a better Way Forward with China. Literally and metaphorically, the infrastructure of our Heartland region is built on the backs of Chinese-Americans â€“ a sociological history that has been largely ignored. But how have we gotten here as a country? Who are the Chinese-Americans in the Heartland region and how did they get where they are today? How does a better understanding of our nation and our history impact our relationships abroad? All of these questions and more will be discussed with Dr. Huping Ling and the Chinese-American Museum of Chicago in a special USHCA Author Series event this February.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
