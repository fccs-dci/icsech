Consequently, nations are diligently pursuing their respective maritime interests, revealing both commonalities and distinctions. The United States and China, widely recognized as major powers in contemporary international politics and prominent maritime nations, are increasingly focusing their attention on global maritime domains.</p>\n\n<p>How do the maritime policies of China and the United States differ in terms of strategic objectives and priorities? What are the primary areas of competition between China and the United States in global maritime affairs? How do the maritime disputes, such as those in the South China Sea, impact the overall relations between China and the United States? Are there any ongoing cooperative efforts between China and the United States in global maritime security or environmental protection? What role do international law and institutions play in shaping the interactions between China and the United States in global maritime relations? How do the military doctrines and strategies of China and the United States intersect or diverge in the maritime domain?</p>\n\n<p>In her new book&nbsp;<em>US-China Global Maritime Relations</em>, Dr. Nong Hong explores the U.S.-China maritime relationship within the global context and investigates six key maritime regions: the South China Sea, the Northeast Asia waters, the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, as well as the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Through detailed observations, this book offers a comprehensive exploration of these regions and their significance in shaping the dynamics between the two nations.</p>\n\n<p>This event will feature the author of&nbsp;<em>US-China Global Maritime Relations</em>, who will discuss the evolution and execution of maritime strategies pursued by both the United States and China. Moreover, three panelists will provide their insights on this subject, representing perspectives from the United States, China, and a third-party viewpoint.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
