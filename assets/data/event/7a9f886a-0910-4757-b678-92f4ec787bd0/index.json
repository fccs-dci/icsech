The Biden Administration, while seeking to constrain Russia has made it clear that its primary emphasis is China and that it sees the country as both an economic rival and a military challenger. The talk will discuss how successful the US can be in its efforts to modify Chinese behaviour and the implications for India.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
