It’s stress-free, there are no precision measurements to follow, and it works just as well here in California as it did back in my home province of Yunnan. I hear a lot of people find Chinese cooking daunting, especially when there are specific sauces or ingredients that are hard to find outside of China, but I’ve got a well-curated list of easy-to-source substitutions, and answers to all your other Chinese-cooking questions. So, I invite you to join me on Friday night as I cook dinner for my family – Chinese noodle soup for the soul (with a healthy green veggie pairing too, of course).</p>\n<p>– Mei Zhang</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
