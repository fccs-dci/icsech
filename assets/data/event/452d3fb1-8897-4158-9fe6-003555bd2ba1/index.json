The dominant view among the US strategic affairs community sees the downing of the “spy balloon,” the cancelled visit of Blinken, and now the refusal by the US president to apologize for “killing” the civilian Chinese airship, as the formal launching of a New Cold War amid increasing hostility between the two rival nations. Although Beijing criticized the US’s “irrational” action as an “overreaction,” analysts abroad and within the mainland are interpreting China’s quick apology for the Chinese flying object mistakenly entering the US air space as [China’s] unwillingness to escalate “balloon” row. Besides, other voices, including the Washington-based think tank CSIS, the Wall Street Journal, and a high-ranking Chinese diplomat, have argued that the entire matter should have been treated and dealt with as a diplomatic episode. The&nbsp;<em>chargé d'affaires</em>&nbsp;of the Chinese embassy in Washington Xu Xueyuan wrote in an article in the US media that China-US relations should not be “led astray by a wandering balloon.” The raison&nbsp;<em>d’etre</em>&nbsp;for downplaying the controversy has been interpreted by some as Beijing’s objective to “restore and develop the economy” that has been dragged down by the three-year epidemic in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>This panel discussion will analyse the incident and deliberate on the following questions: a) has the storm over the balloon robbed Washington and Beijing of an opportunity; b) if this is really the beginning of a New Cold War, what are the security implications in the Indo-Pacific; c) does an intensification of US-China competition indicate that China could queer the pitch for India’s G20 presidency this year; d) is the balloon row really the spectacle that the Biden administration will use “to push its stuttering election cart”; and, last but not least, e) what does one make of the fact that China figured at least five times in Biden’s POTA speech.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
