Increasing nationalism throughout the region, the rise of China as a great power, and military rivalries have complicated transnational attempts to confront critical global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. The limits of military force in the post-World War II era underscore the imperative for renewed efforts at diplomacy. Multilateral relationships such as the Quad – comprised of Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S. – are reshaping regional dynamics. Through an exploration of the U.S.-China relationship, the nuclear threat from North Korea, and border conflicts between China and India, this talk will analyze the role of strategic engagement as a tool to mitigate the risk of interstate conflict and improve transnational cooperation.<br />\nDr. Katz is the author of Defence Diplomacy: Strategic Engagement and Interstate Conflict (Routledge, 2020).</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
