The Chinese early on pointed out that there was an ‘elegant speech’,&nbsp;<i>yǎyán</i>&nbsp;雅言, which was the prestige language of the elite, and there were also&nbsp;<i>fāngyán</i>&nbsp;方言 ‘dialects’ and a&nbsp;<i>tōngyǔ</i>&nbsp;通語, a lingua franca or koine used in broader communication across dialects and languages. Beginning in the Ming Dynasty, this lingua franca came to be called 官話&nbsp;<i>Guānhuà</i>, literally “the language used by officials,” now translated as ‘Mandarin’. Guānhuà at that time was not simply a single language, but rather existed in at least two loosely understood varieties. This lecture will explore the Mandarin described by Western missionaries when they came into contact with spoken Chinese during the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as the origin and evolution of Guānhuà. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the diverse dialect origins of Mandarin as well as of Western perceptions of China’s rich linguistic environment in traditional times.<br />\n<br />\n- Language: English (supplemented by Putonghua)<br />\n- Venue: SWT 702, Level 7, Shaw Tower, Hong Kong Baptist University<br />\n- Online: ZOOM<br />\nLink:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/96903819508?pwd=bFhSTGF0alM0Z0U0YjRTaHYrYnlDZz09\" target=\"_blank\">https://hkbu.zoom.us/j/96903819508?pwd=bFhSTGF0alM0Z0U0YjRTaHYrYnlDZz09</a><br />\nMeeting ID: 969 0381 9508<br />\nPassword: 973008<br />\n<br />\nThis lecture series is sponsored by Eurasia Foundation (from Asia).
