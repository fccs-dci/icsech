Less attention has been given to efforts undertaken by the government of PRC President Xi Jinping in the last decade to attack these problems. Join us for the third edition of our 2021 Sigur Center Lecture Series on environmental realities in contemporary China with Jennifer Turner of the Wilson Center and Dr. Judy Shapiro of American University. Following a discussion moderated by GW Professor Robert Shepherd, the panelists will turn to an audience Q&amp;A session. The webinar begins at 12 PM EST on Thursday, April 22. Registered guests will receive an email with instructions for joining WebEx prior to the event. Registration closes at 12:00 PM EST on Wednesday, April 21. This event is open to the public and will be recorded.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
