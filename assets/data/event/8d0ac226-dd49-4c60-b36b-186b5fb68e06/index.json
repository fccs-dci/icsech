World Factory, a non-narrative, experimental documentary-based production, considered China’s new working class from historical, subjective, psychic, and social perspectives. Performances were also venues for intense and heated discussion with the audience. 2016, as the character of the Xi Jinping regime became more and more clear, marked an apogee not only for the performance, but for the Chinese worker’s movement in general. This talk traces Grass Stage’s trajectory from World Factory to the present, and uses that trajectory as a diagnosis of the state of political subjectivity and the fate of social critique.</p>\n\n<p><a data-msys-clicktrack=\"0\" href=\"https://humanities.ucsc.edu/academics/faculty/regular-faculty.php?uid=cconnery\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://humanities.ucsc.edu/academics/faculty/regular-faculty.php?uid=cconnery\"><strong><strong>Christopher Connery</strong></strong>&nbsp;</a>is Professor in the Literature department at the University of California Santa Cruz, where he teaches Cultural Studies, Chinese Studies, and courses in Marxist and neoliberal theory. He has also served recently as Visiting Professor in the graduate department of Cultural Studies at Shanghai University. His research has involved four areas: early imperial Chinese culture and history (&nbsp;<em><em>Empire of the Text: Writing and Authority in Early Imperial China ;</em></em><em><em>&nbsp;</em></em>contributions to the&nbsp;<em><em>Columbia History of Chinese Literature</em></em>) ; oceanic ideology and mythos in global capitalism (articles in&nbsp;<em><em>boundary 2</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>Journal of Historical Geography</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>PMLA</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>Harvard Design Magazine</em></em>, et al); the global 1960s (various anthologized articles, plus special issues of&nbsp;<em><em>boundary 2</em></em><em><em>&nbsp;</em></em>and&nbsp;<em><em>Inter-Asia Cultural Studies</em></em>); and contemporary Chinese culture, ideology, and politics (articles in&nbsp;<em><em>Made in China</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>boundary 2</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>New Left Review</em></em>, et al). Since 2010 he has been involved as writer, performer, and political consultant in the Shanghai-based, Chinese-language social and experimental theater group Grass Stage, which has performed throughout China, as well as in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Macao, and North America.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the Sydney China Distinguished Fellowship Program 2024, this event is co-hosted by the&nbsp;<a data-msys-clicktrack=\"0\" href=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/EJk3C4QOPEiz3lPNKi1vN7q?domain=t.e2ma.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/EJk3C4QOPEiz3lPNKi1vN7q?domain=t.e2ma.net\">Discipline of Chinese Studies</a>&nbsp;in the School of Languages and Cultures, the&nbsp;<a data-msys-clicktrack=\"0\" href=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/4xzqC5QPXJiM468mLUguWNm?domain=t.e2ma.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/4xzqC5QPXJiM468mLUguWNm?domain=t.e2ma.net\">China Studies Centre</a>&nbsp;at the University of Sydney.
