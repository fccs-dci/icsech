Questioning a traditional notion of infrastructure that focuses solely on architectures and utilities, Dr. Heck will show in her presentation, how revival churches have become powerful infrastructural actors, of which Congolese migrants, make use on their migratory routes and beyond. Dr. Heckâ€™s presentation is based on findings from a multi-sited ethnography on the role of (neo) Pentecostal churches on the migration routes of Congolese migrants, which she carried out since 2010.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
