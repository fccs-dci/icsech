Secretary Blinken was followed in quick succession by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Special Climate Envoy John Kerry, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Reciprocally, Beijing’s new Ambassador to the U.S. Xie Feng continues to adjust to his new role, appointed in March, and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi is anticipated to formally visit Washington in the coming months. With this uptick and revival of in-person visits, the United States and China appear to be inching closer to stabilizing their rocky relationship; a goal that both nations have emphasized this year. As the two sides return to their Bali agenda, a critical next step will be to translate their mutual intentions into real actions.<br />\n<br />\nIs that possible at this late hour in the Biden administration’s term in office? Can the two sides take specific steps to resolutely stop “gray rhinos”, properly handle “black swans” and thoroughly remove “tigers blocking the way”, and thus create conditions and remove disruptions for stabilizing U.S.-China relations? Or with election season looming, is the exchange of good intentions about the best that can be expected from the two sides? Will the window to stabilize ties shut tight by the end of the year as election polemics kick-in and China is used as a beating stick by the Biden administration’s political opponents? What does 2024 portend for U.S.-China relations, both politically and on the economic decoupling front?</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
