This talk argues for the continued relevance of neoliberalism to an understanding of China today, and suggests that China’s particular and limited neoliberal character offers insights into the nature of contemporary capitalism, and of its antagonists.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>About the speaker</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><a data-msys-clicktrack=\"0\" href=\"https://humanities.ucsc.edu/academics/faculty/regular-faculty.php?uid=cconnery\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://humanities.ucsc.edu/academics/faculty/regular-faculty.php?uid=cconnery\"><strong><strong>Christopher Connery</strong></strong>&nbsp;</a>is Professor in the Literature department at the University of California Santa Cruz, where he teaches Cultural Studies, Chinese Studies, and courses in Marxist and neoliberal theory. He has also served recently as Visiting Professor in the graduate department of Cultural Studies at Shanghai University. His research has involved four areas: early imperial Chinese culture and history (&nbsp;<em><em>Empire of the Text: Writing and Authority in Early Imperial China ;</em></em><em><em>&nbsp;</em></em>contributions to the&nbsp;<em><em>Columbia History of Chinese Literature</em></em>) ; oceanic ideology and mythos in global capitalism (articles in&nbsp;<em><em>boundary 2</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>Journal of Historical Geography</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>PMLA</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>Harvard Design Magazine</em></em>, et al); the global 1960s (various anthologized articles, plus special issues of&nbsp;<em><em>boundary 2</em></em><em><em>&nbsp;</em></em>and&nbsp;<em><em>Inter-Asia Cultural Studies</em></em>); and contemporary Chinese culture, ideology, and politics (articles in&nbsp;<em><em>Made in China</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>boundary 2</em></em>,&nbsp;<em><em>New Left Review</em></em>, et al). Since 2010 he has been involved as writer, performer, and political consultant in the Shanghai-based, Chinese-language social and experimental theater group Grass Stage, which has performed throughout China, as well as in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Macao, and North America.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the Sydney China Distinguished Fellowship Program 2024, this event is co-hosted by the&nbsp;<a data-msys-clicktrack=\"0\" href=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/EJk3C4QOPEiz3lPNKi1vN7q?domain=t.e2ma.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/EJk3C4QOPEiz3lPNKi1vN7q?domain=t.e2ma.net\">Discipline of Chinese Studies</a>&nbsp;in the School of Languages and Cultures, the&nbsp;<a data-msys-clicktrack=\"0\" href=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/4xzqC5QPXJiM468mLUguWNm?domain=t.e2ma.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/4xzqC5QPXJiM468mLUguWNm?domain=t.e2ma.net\">China Studies Centre</a>&nbsp;at the University of Sydney.
