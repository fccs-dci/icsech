He posits that capitalism is a polymorphic system in which the logic of uneven development is structurally inscribed. More specifically, he argues that China’s current efforts to rebalance its institutional geography (during its so-called ‘new normal’) can be analyzed as a transitional process towards post-industrial development.</p>\n<p>With:<br />\nAlexander L.Q.
