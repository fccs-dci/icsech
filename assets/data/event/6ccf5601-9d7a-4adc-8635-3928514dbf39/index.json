At the age of 80, Thubron undertook a journey like none other: a 3000-mile trek tracing the enigmatic waterway of the Amur River—the tenth longest river in the world—that winds dangerously between the two superpowers. Long hidden from Western eyes, the Amur River has been the subject of wars, treaties, imperial failures, and horrific genocides. Thubron provides a double vision of past and present as he recounts his travels by horseback through the steppes of Mongolia, and then by wheezing Chinese buses, cars, poachers’ boats, and the Trans-Siberian railroad. Following his talk, Thubron will be joined for a conversation with Seattle-based author and journalist Blaine Harden.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
