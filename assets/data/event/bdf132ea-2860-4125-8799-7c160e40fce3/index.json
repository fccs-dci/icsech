States are traditionally held responsible only for their own conduct. In principle, the corporate veil would have to be lifted for a home state to be held responsible for the conduct of its SOEs abroad. Professor Baetens will talk about the challenges this presents to the WTO and international investment and human rights law.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
