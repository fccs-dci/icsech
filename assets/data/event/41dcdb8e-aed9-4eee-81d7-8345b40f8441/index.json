Having positioned themselves as collective possessors of the Way 道, these intellectuals claimed recognition as moral guides for both rulers and society at large. A major way in which they asserted their superiority over rulers was by proliferating historical (and quasi-historical) narratives that uniformly cast rulers as recipients of their advisers’ wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>In this lecture, I will explore the counter-discourse aimed at undermining intellectuals’ authority. Two texts stand out for their systematic assault on fellow intellectuals. The&nbsp;<em>Book of Lord Shang</em>&nbsp;(<em>Shangjunshu&nbsp;</em>商君書) was arguably the earliest major text to turn the tables on intellectuals who sought appointment on the basis of perceived moral superiority. But it was&nbsp;<em>Han Feizi</em>&nbsp;韓非子 that most mercilessly exposed the moralizers’ fallacies and their abuse of history. The assault by the authors of these texts on their fellow intellectuals created a paradox, though. In dismissing their rivals’ claims to offer moral guidance to rulers, the authors also undermined their own intellectual authority over the throne. Moreover, they ruined forever their texts’ prestige in the eyes of the educated elite. Why did they adopt the stance of “class traitors”? What can we learn from their example about the power and the weakness of Chinese intellectuals—from the Warring States era on and well into the present? And how do internal cleavages among Chinese intellectuals resonate elsewhere? This lecture shall address these questions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Speaker</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yuri Pines 尤銳&nbsp;</strong>is&nbsp;Michael W.
