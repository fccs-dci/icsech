In his latest book China’s Grand Strategy and Australia’s Future in the New Global Order, Dr. Raby provides hard-hitting analysis on the rise of China and sharp proposals for restoring the worsening Australia-China relations back on track. What is China’s grand strategy? Is China a rising aggressive hegemon or a “constrained superpower” driven by insecurity? How to reduce tensions in the Asia Pacific region and avoid the risk of war? What are the lessons Canada and other middle powers can learn from Australia’s engagement with China? Please join Ambassador Raby live from Australia for the EASF’s closing keynote speech, followed by a one-on-one discussion moderated by IPD advisory board member Dr. Wenran Jiang.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
