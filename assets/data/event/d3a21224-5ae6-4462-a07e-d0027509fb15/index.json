We believe that view is overly optimistic, for it overlooks how operational culture, bureaucratic incentives, and the temptation to strike first are creating the circumstances for a perfect storm. In our talk, we will outline what the dangers are and why we need to pay more attention to them.<br />\nJonathan D. Caverley is Professor of Strategy in the Strategic &amp; Operational Research Department of the Naval War Collegeâ€™s Center for Naval Warfare Studies and a Research Scientist in Political Science and Security Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br />\nDr Peter Dombrowski is the William D.
