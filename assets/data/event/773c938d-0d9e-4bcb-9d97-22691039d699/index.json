However, non-canonical texts published for Chinese children in the late Qing dynasty, particularly children’s periodicals, have received less critical attention. This talk explores the construction of Chinese childhood in&nbsp;<em>Xiaohai yuebao&nbsp;</em>(<em>The Child’s Paper</em>, 1875–1915) and&nbsp;<em>Mengxue bao</em>&nbsp;(<em>The Children’s Educator</em>, ca 1897–1906). The former was a monthly produced by Protestant missionaries that included not only Bible stories but also articles on natural history, astronomy, and physiology. The latter was the first Chinese-run children’s magazine started by Chinese reformers which also published columns on nineteenth-century science. This seminar will consider how the two periodicals constructed the image of the ‘scientific’ child. Produced in an environment fraught with anxieties about China’s future, the two magazines mobilized the figure of the child to argue for the need to empower the younger generation by equipping them with scientific knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><em>The ANU China Seminar Series is supported by the Australian Centre on China in the World at ANU College of Asia and the Pacific.</em></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
