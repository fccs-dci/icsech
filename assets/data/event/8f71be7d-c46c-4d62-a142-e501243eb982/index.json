Each conversation will feature three world-renowned experts offering their views on a select question, moderated by a faculty member of the University of Oxford China Centre. Our goal is to foster conversation and debate that will be of interest to specialists while remaining accessible to a broad public audience. Sessions will last one hour, with the first forty-five minutes consisting of a moderated discussion between the invited speakers, and the last quarter hour offering audience participants the opportunity to submit questions to be asked by the moderator. We will be using the Zoom webinar format, and the first forty-five minutes will also be recorded to be made available online for public viewing subsequently.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
