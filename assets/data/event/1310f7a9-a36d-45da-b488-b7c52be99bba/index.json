In November 2023, President Biden and President Xi agreed to establish a govt-to-govt mechanism to discuss AI at their summit in Woodside, California, and a US-China working group on AI is expected to hold talks later this spring. Alongside, American AI companies have engaged in discussions with Chinese AI experts, and leading scientists of both nations have jointly put out calls for tighter controls on the technology.</p>\n\n<p>As the U.S.-China working group on AI convenes later this spring, what are the set of priority areas to be discussed? Have the parameters of their discussion been established? What are the areas of common interest that are drawing the two sides together? Do the U.S. and China share a common vision of the core ‘red lines’ that powerful AI systems should not cross? Do they trust their counterpart enough to limit their own capability voluntarily? Can the U.S.-China talks, along with their discussions with the EU, serve as a building block for a multilateral treaty, say, on the lines of the 1960s-era Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? Furthermore, what is the particular Chinese interest in these talks? And where does AI sit within the larger scheme of China’s technological advancement aspirations? To listen to these and other answers and insights on pressing U.S.-China AI policy questions, tune in to the event on April 10th.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
