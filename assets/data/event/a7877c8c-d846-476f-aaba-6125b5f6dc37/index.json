And how should we understand what has been called the &#039;internet celebrity city&#039; (wanghong chengshi) and &#039;internet celebrity&#039; aesthetics in contemporary urbanism? To consider these issues, Dr Amy Yueming Zhang will discuss how an aesthetic of arts districts is constructed, turning arts districts into not only places for consumption but also places to be consumed in China. The talk first considers how two art districts, 798 in Beijing and Huangjueping in Chongqing, are portrayed and imagined in mass media, local knowledge, and public discourses. Through an analysis of the districts, two aesthetic aspects are identified: a mystery aesthetic and a collage aesthetic. Dr Zhang and discussants will then consider how &#039;internet celebrity city&#039; (wanghong chengshi) has come to be, the influence of the internet celebrity (wanghong) aesthetic and the impact of influencers and their followers on urbanism.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
