But its foreign policy initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, are shaped and redefined as they confront the ground realities of local and regional politics outside China. Daniel S. Markey, in his new book China’s Western Horizon, describes and analyzes these complex processes in South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Drawing from extensive interviews, travels, and historical research, he provides the in-depth studies of the dynamics that China’s involvement in Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Iran has created. Markey anticipates that China’s expanding influence will not bring greater stability and peace to this difficult part of the world, and might exacerbate conflicts within and among Eurasian states. He argues that U.S. policy makers should have a clear grasp of local histories, interests and relationships to effectively advance America’s specific diplomatic, economic, and security interests in Eurasia, whether in common cause with Beijing or when working at cross purposes. At this event, Daniel S. Markey will present some of the key arguments of his book. Andrew Small will discuss the book and provide an overview of the European perspectives on China’s engagement in Eurasia. Policy options for U.S. and European policy makers will be explored.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
