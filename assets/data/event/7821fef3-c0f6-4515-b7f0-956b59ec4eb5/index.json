Since its association with 19th-century innovations in European and American drama, theatrical realism has largely remained limited to Euro-American definitions. We explore conventions of realism in culturally-specific locations and times across East Asia, articulating alternative histories of realism that extend from the premodern into the present. Through our individual inquiries, we aim to broaden the termâ€™s analytic power and shed collective light on the diversity and versatility of this important representational mode. The conference will end with a play reading performed by LAUNCH PAD, UCSB.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
