On the other hand, it also has the world’s most sophisticated state-led censorship, surveillance, and propaganda mechanism. There is enough evidence to suggest that legal, political, and technological tools to bring the cyber rhetoric in tune with the party line have been strengthened since 2013. In this context, the political echo chamber around the current Chinese leadership seems to be making the situation even more complex. The ability to track digital information has expanded the state's reach in many countries across the world. However, the Chinese party-state has used technological innovation so extensively, that it is increasingly blurring the line between information and misinformation. Active state intervention in the social, political, cultural, and even economic digital spaces is intensifying concerns about the credibility of nearly all available information. In sum, the vulnerability of digital information to state control is heightened due to restricted institutional scope and mechanism to course correct. The outcome is a centralisation of rhetoric in the cyber domain, in favour of the ruling Communist Party and the country's top leadership and anything contradicting the official line is likely to invite a backlash. This could however severely limit the party-state's capacity to receive feedback from the ground.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
