Their research show that despite extreme levels of surveillance in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, the same schemes in use in Xinjiang are also being used across the country from large cities to small towns. Whether they are assessing residents’ basic needs or trying to predict future behavior, officials engaged in surveillance are pursuing a single goal: to keep China’s citizens under near-constant watch. This webinar will be moderated by UC San Diego professor Victor Shih.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
