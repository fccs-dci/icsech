But performative governance is hard work. Environmental bureaucrats paradoxically work themselves to exhaustion even when they cannot effectively implement environmental policies. Instead of achieving “performance legitimacy” through actual good governance and its desirable outcomes, the state can shape public opinion with theatrical performance of goodwill and sincere effort. The book also explains why performative governance sometimes fails at impressing its audience, and when governance becomes less performative and more substantive.  </p>\n\n<p>Iza Ding is an assistant professor of political science and public policy at the University of Pittsburgh. Her research examines two interconnected issues that are becoming more challenging and consequential than ever: environmental and climate politics and policy, and the politics of autocracy and democracy. Her articles have appeared in World Politics, Comparative Political Studies, Democratization, Studies in Comparative and International Development, and China Quarterly. Her book The Performative State: Public Scrutiny and Environmental Governance in China is forthcoming with Cornell University Press in summer 2022. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Presented via Zoom webinarRegister at: <a href=\"https://harvard.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_1knAizOSR-ih45-cmS5-rQ\">https://harvard.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_1knAizOSR-ih45-cmS5-rQ</a></strong></p>"}}},"context":{}}
