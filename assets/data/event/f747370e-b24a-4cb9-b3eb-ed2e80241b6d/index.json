Is the country experiencing a steady expansion of private businesses, or a new advance of state enterprises? In this talk, Andrew Batson will introduce new estimates of the economic size and structure of China&#039;s state-owned enterprise sector, which turn out to have been remarkably stable over the past quarter century. He will discuss what these research findings show about the nature of China&#039;s political system, how they affect our understanding of the history of China&#039;s reform era, and what they mean for the future trajectory of China&#039;s economy.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
