Remarkably, the model that revolutionary leader Zhou Enlai established continues to this day despite the massive changes the country has undergone in recent decades. China&#039;s Diplomats embody the PRC&#039;s battle between insecurity and self-confidence, internally and externally. They&#039;re often dubbed China&#039;s &quot;wolf warriors&quot; for their combative approach to asserting Chinese interests. Drawing for the first time on the memoirs of more than a hundred retired diplomats as well as author Peter Martin&#039;s first-hand reporting as a journalist in Beijing, this groundbreaking book blends history with current events to tease out enduring lessons about the kind of power China is set to become. It is required reading for anyone who wants to understand China&#039;s quest for global power, as seen from the inside.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
