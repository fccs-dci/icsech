There are hundreds of cities in China with more than one million population. The Pearl River delta has become a region of megacities. From Upper Yangtze in the South West to the entire east China, modern cities have sprung up in ways that nearly obliterate the country’s agrarian past. How did China become a predominantly urban society in a span of four decades since the reforms? Literature on China’s urban development focusing on town planning, manufacturing and factory towns, or migration do not explain this urbanization story. The talk would provide a retrospective perspective to understand urban development in contemporary China. The origins of China’s urban development can be traced back to imperial era country capitals, river basin cities, coastal towns and the traditional walled cities. Besides, the geographical concentration of China’s urbanization still largely corresponds to historical urban regions of the east. The great rivers of Huang he, Chang Jiang and Zhu jiang are home to vast urban populations. The speaker would argue that China’s urban development in the post-reform era, is in part a derivative outcome from the cities in history that precedes the imperial period.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
