The talk aims to provide insights into China's strategic initiatives aimed at mitigating criticism and gaining support from Muslim-majority nations. Drawing from existing literature on China's religious diplomacy, the concept of 'Muslim diplomacy' is developed to analyze China's diverse strategies within the Indonesian context. The analysis identifies four key components of China's 'Muslim diplomacy' in Indonesia: 1) Shaping Positive Narratives: Examining how China strategically communicates its Xinjiang actions to Indonesian officials, constructing a narrative that aligns with its goals and minimizes potential criticism; 2) Cultivating Relations with Muslim Organizations: Investigating China's engagement with various Muslim organizations in Indonesia, exploring relationship dynamics and their impact on shaping public opinion; 3) Scholarships and Educational Collaborations: Analyzing China's initiatives in providing scholarships to Muslim students and collaborating with Islamic educational institutions, exploring the influence of these efforts on shaping perceptions among Indonesian Muslims. 4) Media Outreach: Exploring China's media strategy to convey positive messages about its actions, examining the channels and content through which it seeks to influence public opinion within Indonesia.</span></span></span></p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
