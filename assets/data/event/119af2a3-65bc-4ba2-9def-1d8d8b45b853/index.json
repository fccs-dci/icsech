Since 2016, financing has steadily declined, dropping from a peak of $28.4 billion to $8.3 billion in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, the most serious global health crisis of the past century, has severely impacted development and commercial finance budgets around the world, including China’s. For many African countries in particular, the pandemic has also had severe social and economic impacts. Already fragile welfare systems have been threatened or overwhelmed and African intraregional and international trade, investment flows and access to financing has also been adversely affected. The full impact is still unfolding.</p>\n\n<p>Amid these economic impacts, how has the pandemic impacted Chinese lending to Africa? What trends have emerged and which have endured? How have Chinese financiers adapted to changing economic and political conditions in Africa as they learn from experiences with borrowers in debt distress and debt restructuring negotiations? And what factors might shape Chinese lending to Africa in the post-pandemic era?</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, April 28, 9:00-10:00 AM EDT / 15:00-14:00 CET, join the Boston University Global Development Policy Center for a webinar discussion and 2020 data release for the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
