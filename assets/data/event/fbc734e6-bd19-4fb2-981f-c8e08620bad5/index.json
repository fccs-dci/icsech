Does this mean international law no longer matters in Hong Kong? Our speaker, <a href=\"https://law.hawaii.edu/people/petersen/\">Carole Petersen</a>, professor of law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, finds that in cases not affecting Beijing’s core interests, local judges still rely on international and comparative sources and still rule against the local Hong Kong government. This has been particularly evident in strategic litigation to advance the rights of the LGBT community. Petersen concludes that if the local government is serious about trying to rebuild Hong Kong’s international reputation, then it should accept and fully implement these rulings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
