Over time, they became a significant part of everyday life for Boston Chinatown families, and a means to send money back home. At the peak, there were 500 Chinese laundries in the New England area. Astounded by these family histories, I created Laundry Rocks, </p>\n<p>How have these histories impacted Boston Chinatown, and what are the implications for current generations? During the discussion, we will be examining Tien’s piece, Laundry Rock, one of the works included in her culminating exhibition as Pao Arts Center’s 2020 Artist-in-Residence. The exhibit Wen-hao Tien: Home on Our Backs, is on view at Pao Arts Center&#039;s website until June 26, 2021.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
