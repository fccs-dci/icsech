Australia’s Chinese past is persistently framed as ‘forgotten’ in public debate, a perpetual newness which ignores forty years of scholarship in the field. Contemporary works on Sino-Australian relations proliferate, resurrecting Cold War mentalities but avoiding Australia’s colonial history of Chinese migration and settlement. In this seminar I account for this forgetfulness while also drawing attention to a spate of recently unearthed Chinese language sources written by Chinese Australians. These sources, newly translated, invite us to see Australia’s past in a Chinese context, revealing a propensity in Australia to organize historical time along European lines, obscuring ties of causality between events in Asia and Australia. Multilingual archives challenge the primacy of English-language sources in the narration of Australia’s past, revealing an architecture of Australia-Asia interconnection often hidden in nationalist conceptions of the past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Speaker</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sophie Loy-Wilson</strong>&nbsp;is a Senior Lecturer in Australian History at the University of Sydney.
