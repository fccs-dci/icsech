He will show how the securitization of non-traditional security threats overseas played a key role in shaping the behavior and preferences of Chinese policymakers and military elites, especially with regard to the role of the armed forces in foreign policy. </p>\n<p>While Chinese policymakers were able to overcome important organizational challenges, the future of China&#039;s approach to the protection of its interests overseas remains uncertain as Chinese policymakers face important questions about the possible political and diplomatic costs associated with different courses of action.</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
