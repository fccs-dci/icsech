To analyse these debates and illuminate the underlying issues, Open University’s Re-orienting development: The dynamics and effects of Chinese infrastructure investments in Europe (REDEFINE) project, the University of York’s The politics of Chinese investments in Europe (PoliCIE), and the China in Europe Research Network (CHERN) are co-organising a series of events. We envisage these events to offer a platform for learning and sharing for students and early career researchers in the social sciences and allied disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>The series is informed by four themes, as below:</p>\n\n<p>• To what extent does China’s growing presence in and engagement with the global North and global South reshape the liberal international order?</p>\n\n<p>• What does China’s rise do for concepts like the global South and how can we more effectively study the political economies of societies of the so-called global South?</p>\n\n<p>• What does China’s entry into Europe mean for European identity and how can we more effectively study the political economies of European societies?</p>\n\n<p>• What methodological opportunities and challenges does researching China in Europe pose for collaborative knowledge creation?</p>\n\n<p>Each event will typically entail a presentation by a graduate student or early career scholar followed by comments by an established academic.</p>\n\n<p>Come along to the launch event in June and hear&nbsp;<strong>Jilong Yang&nbsp;</strong>from Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam speak on<strong>&nbsp;'</strong><strong><em>China’s Strategic Shift and Sino-EU Relations in Global Governance: The Quest for Identity?</em></strong><strong>'</strong></p>\n\n<p>Audience Q&amp;A will follow</p>\n"}}},"context":{}}
